Through the Internet Radio Services, you \ncan listen to live radio stations and add media catalogs and music \nservices without updating devices or software. \nDefault tone and song files include white noise and pink noise that \nallows you to tune paging and audio distribution volumes. \nNote: Before using the audio file management feature, make sure \nthat stations and zones have been configured (see \"Managing Sta-\ntions, Zones, and Queues\u201d on page 105) and that the station you are \nusing to launch announcements, tones, or Audio Distribution has \nthe appropriate CoS parameters set (see \"Using CoS Configuration\u201d \non page 63).\n248\n9.1\nAudio Distribution\nSuppose you want to use an audio source, such as a radio station \naccessed via the Internet, in a cafeteria but prevent that source from \nbeing played in a conference room. This feature, called Audio Distri-\nbution, can be turned on by zone (an area or group of stations) or \nstations (group of devices such as VoIP speakers). You can add the \nspeakers, or stations, in the cafeteria to a zone that allows Audio Dis-\ntribution while the speakers in a conference room would not be \nplaced into that zone.\nAudio Distribution involves creating a playlist or selecting an input \nsource and specifying which zones hear the playlist or input source. \nThrough the Scheduled Audio feature, Audio Distribution can be tied \nto a specific event in a schedule (see \"Adding an Event\u201d on page 227).\nFigure 9-1, Audio Distribution Sources\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe Schedules feature allows you to set specific times for audio programs, tones, and announcements to automatically play in designated stations or zones. By linking audio playback to a schedule, you can ensure that the desired audio content is delivered at the right moments without manual intervention.<|eot_id|>","token_count":567}

The available parameters are:\n\u2022 AUTO_FIND_COUNTY. Automatically discovers the county code \nassociated with the Nyquist server\u2019s public IP address. \n\u2022 AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer>. Automatically compresses the \ndisplay message if the number of lines in the message exceeds the \n<Integer> value. For example, AUTO_COMPRESS_15 will cause \nmessages that contain more than 15 lines to be compressed by \nremoving end-of-line characters (lines will run together, separated \nby a space instead of end-of-line). The resulting message will per-\nhaps be more difficult to read than the original. Use this option if \nNote: The font size will automatically resize to 20 if the Alert mes-\nsage has these following parameters:\n\u2022 Priority is smaller than 6.\n\u2022 Text length is longer than 1500 characters.\n\u2022 The text has more than 500 capital letter characters.\nThe font size also automatically resizes to 20 if needed, even if the \n$auto_resize variable is not specified.\nNote: This option is not recommended if the server\u2019s physical \nlocation is in a different county from your facility, if your server \nresides in the cloud, or if you are tracking alerts for multiple facili-\nties and those facilities are not in the same county. Instead, find \nand use your county code.\n467\nyou want to ensure that messages will fit on the screen.

Instructions are usually obvious (like seek shelter, stay \nindoors, stay hydrated). However, instructions can be verbose and, \nwhile they can provide valuable information, verbose instructions \ncould cause the messages to be too large to display properly.\nNote: Font sizes are set in the Display Message options (see \"Cre-\nating a Display Message\u201d on page 438). For weather alerts, the fol-\nlowing settings are recommended for the Liberation Sans font:\n\u2022 30 - When not using the AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer> option \nof the $alerts variable and not using the $auto_resize variable. A \nfont size of 30 will ensure that the actual lines from the NWS \nwill fit on each line displayed.\n\u2022 65 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_15 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 40 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_25 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 70 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_<Inter> and $auto_resize \nvariable with display message priority of 6.\nNote: County codes are available at: https:\/\/alerts-v2.weather.gov\/\ncounties.\n468\n\u2022 REPEAT_<Integer>. Automatically repeats the alert processing \nand re-displays any resulting alerts every <Integer> seconds. Pre-\nvious alerts are automatically removed from displays. This option \nprovides a convenient way to check for and display alerts at a reg-\nular interval without having to create a routine loop and without \nhaving to worry about deleting previous or expired alerts. When \nthis option is used, no subsequent actions will be executed in the \nRoutine that executes the Display-Msg action. Since alert pro-\ncessing requires Internet access processing, Bogen recommends a \nminimum <Integer> value of 60 seconds. Using less than 60 sec-\nonds may significantly impact your network and Nyquist server \nprocessing utilization.\n\u2022 UPDATE_CACHE. Nyquist caches the found county code so the \nsystem does not have to search more than one time. \nIf your county code changes, you can include the option \nUPDATE_CACHE along with AUTO_FIND_COUNTY to have the \nsystem discover the county code and cache the new value. \nNote: You should delete the UPDATE_CACHE option after use; \notherwise, the Nyquist system searches for the county code each \ntime alerts are retrieved.\n469\nA sample alert string is:\n$alerts(FLC095,INCLUDE_CODES,AUTO_COMPRESS_15,REPEAT_60) \nThis string will display alerts for county code FLC095 (Orange County, \nFlorida) every 60 seconds including the Severity, Certainty, Urgency, \nand Repose codes, while automatically compressing alerts that have \nmore than 15 lines.\n16.4\nDemonstration Alerts\nSeveral demonstration, or sample, Alerts are available for display. \nThese samples represent typical alerts sent by the NWS for various \nalert types.\nYou can access these by replacing the <County-Code> with \nALERT_DEMO<number> where <number> is replaced with a number \nbetween 1 and 20 (for example, ALERT_DEMO10).

This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX \ndefined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.\nThe steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-\npoint for an IP-PBX are:\n1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone\/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-\ntem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone\/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, \nthe username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system \nwill attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint \nextension using the provided username (extension) and password \npair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to \naccess the Nyquist system.\n2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-\ntem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system.

The Edit Routine page allows you to set \nother parameters for the routine (see Table 13-1, \u201cRoutines Parame-\nters,\u201d on page 385).\nNote: When a Routine is added, edited, or deleted, all Admin \nphones will automatically be rebooted to update their Routines \nmenu.\n388\nTo edit a routine:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nOn the Routines page, select the Edit icon.\nStep 3\nComplete the changes for the parameters on the Edit \nRoutines page (see \"Routines Parameters\u201d on page 385). \nStep 4\nSelect Save.\nFigure 13-2, Edit Routine\n389\n13.7\nDeleting a Routine\nUse caution when deleting routines. If you delete a routine and then \nrecreate it, you may need to assign a new DTMF Code if the previous \ncode was assigned to another routine.\nTo delete a routine:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nOn the Routines page, select the Delete icon next to \nthe routine that you want to delete.\nStep 3\nWhen prompted, select Delete.\n13.8\nCreating and Executing Multi-Site Routines\nYou can create a routine to be launched on one or more remote sites, \nsuch as a lockdown routine to be launched at all sites in a district.\nTo create such a routine, you would select the Routine action Type \n(see \"Actions\u201d on page 402 and \"Understanding Action Parameters\u201d on \npage 406). You can select to execute the action on the local facility, a \nspecific facility, or all facility. If you want to execute the routine or \nmultiple, but not all, facilities, you must create a separate action for \neach facility (using Routine action Type).\nWhen you select a specific facility, you can enter the DTMF code of \nthe routine. A routine with that DTMF code must exist on that facility.\nRoutines that are triggered by another site will not execute calling or \npaging type actions. Also, the receiving facility must have Use Caller \nExtension disabled.\nNote: There will be a one-second delay between execution of one \nRoutine action and another Routine action. So, if you execute a \nmulti-site routine for 10 sites, there will be 10-second delay \nbetween when the routine starts on the first facility and when it \nstarts on the tenth facility. To eliminate this delay, you can select \nAll Facilities and then ensure that a routine with the specified \nDTMF does not exist on the sites that you do not want to run the \nroutine. If All Facilities is selected, the remote routines start at the \nsame time.\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo add a new routine on the Routines page, select Routines from the navigation bar and then click the Add icon.

This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX \ndefined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.\nThe steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-\npoint for an IP-PBX are:\n1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone\/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-\ntem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone\/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, \nthe username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system \nwill attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint \nextension using the provided username (extension) and password \npair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to \naccess the Nyquist system.\n2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-\ntem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX \nNote: The station extension used for the DISA Line must be differ-\nent than the extension being used by your IP-PBX.\n77\nuser hears a dial tone.

For installation \ninstructions, refer to the NQ-GA10P, NQ-GA10PV VoIP Intercom \nModule Installation and Use manual.\nYou must set the Ambient Noise Sensor Multicast IP Address and \nAmbient Noise Sensor Multicast Port system parameters (see \"Set-\nting System Parameters\u201d on page 53).\nThen, create a station with Type as Ambient Noise Sensor and \nDevice Type as NQ-GA10P-Intercom Module or NQ-GA10PV-\nIntercom Module (see \"Adding a Station\u201d on page 153). \nTo configure ANS parameters:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Stations.\nStep 2\nSelect the Edit icon for the Ambient Noise Sensor sta-\ntion.\nStep 3\nSelect Configure.\nStep 4\nSelect the Add icon to add an ANS Listener.\nAn ANS Listener is a station that will receive Sound \nPressure Level (SPL) reports from the ANS. For example, \nsuppose you have speakers in a warehouse area that \nyou want the volume to automatically adjust when \nFigure 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor\n145\nnoisy machines are operating. You would add the \nspeaker stations as ANS Listeners. When the SPL in the \nwarehouse increases, the ANS reports the increase to \nthe ANS Listeners and the speakers\u2019 volumes are \nadjusted automatically.\nStep 5\nSet the ANS parameters for the ANS Listener.\nStep 6\nIf you want to remove a station from the ANS Listener \nlist, select the Remove icon on the station\u2019s row.\nStep 7\nWhen all edits are made, select Save.\nTable 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor Parameters\nStation\nDisplays the extension number of the station \nthat is an ANS Listener.

The default value is 20 dB.\nThreshold (dBFS)\nDisplays the decibels relative to full scale \n(dBFS) value at which point the device will \nadjust the volume to compensate for the \nincreased ambient noise volume. This value \nshould be between -40 and 0 dBFS. A fairly \nnoisy environment is around -20 dBFS; quiet \nenvironments are in the range of -40 dBFS. \nThe default value is -20 dBFS.\nVolume Adjust \n(dB)\nDisplays the amount of decibels to stay \nabove the ambient noise level. Setting this to \n0 disables any volume adjustments from the \nANS. The default value is 12 dB.\nSample Length(s) \nDisplays the ambient noise sampling length, \nwhich can range from 1 to 20 seconds. Short \nlengths provide quicker response to changes \nin the ambient noise; longer lengths will \nignore sudden, short fluctuations in the \nambient noise.\n146\n3.2.11\nConfiguring Intercom HDMI Module Display \nOptions\nIf you have a NQ-GA10PV Intercom HDMI Module Device Type, you \ncan set display types for the connected monitor, including the type of \nclock and display colors that appear.\nOptions configured for the station affect the overall appearance of \nthe display, such as the background color for the display and fonts \nused to display date and event.

For example, if you want an \nannouncement to play after an alarm, you want to ensure that the \nZone-Page\nNote: This must \nbe the last action \nof the routine.\nDashboard mes-\nsages created \nduring the rou-\ntine will be \ndeleted when the \nuser disconnects \nthe call.\nZone\n\u2022\nSelected zone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nTable 13-5, Action Types and Parameters (Continued)\nType\nParameter 1\nParameter 2\nParameter 3\nParameter 4\nTable 13-6,  Email Address Formats for Cellular Carriers\nCellular Carrier\nFormat\nAT&T\n<phone number>@txt.att.net\nT-Mobile\n<phone number>@tmomail.net\nSprint\n<phone number>@messaging.sprintpcs.com\nVerizon\n<phone number>@vtext.com OR\n<phone number>@vzwpix.com\nVirgin Mobile\n<phone number>@vmobl.com","question":"What is the use of variables like $caller in Display Messages?","answer":"Variables like $caller in Display Messages are used to dynamically insert specific information into the displayed text, such as the ID or phone number of the caller triggering the routine.

Cloning an action \ncreates a duplicate of the selected action and places the duplicate at \nthe end of the action list.\nYou can edit a cloned action if you want to change any of the param-\neters, such as duration.\nTo clone an action:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nSelect Actions for the routine that has the action you \nwant to clone.\nStep 3\nSelect the Clone button (\n) for the action that you \nwant to duplicate.\n13.11.5\nUnderstanding Action Parameters\nAn action can have up to four parameters, depending on the Type \nselected. \nWhen viewing actions, the parameters appear as Parameter 1, \nParameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action \npage, though, the parameter names and available selections change \nbased on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field \ncalled Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the \ntones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see \"Viewing Avail-\nable Tones\u201d on page 256). With this type of action, you can also set \nthe Duration, which appears on the Actions page as Parameter 3. \nParameters 2 and 4 are not used for this type of action, but you can \nset a Finish Delay, which establishes if the routine should wait until \nthis action is completed before starting the next action.\nSome actions have no parameters. For example, if you select All-Call \nfor Type, no parameters are applicable.\nThe following table describes the action Type and any applicable \nparameters.\n407\nTable 13-5, Action Types and Parameters\nType\nParameter 1\nParameter 2\nParameter 3\nParameter 4\nAlarm\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done.\nAlarm\n\u2022\nSelected alarm\nNone\nDuration\n\u2022\nNumber of \nseconds for \naction to con-\ntinue; default is \n86400 seconds \n(24 hours)\nNone\nAll-Call\nNote: All-Call \nmust be the last \naction in a routine.\nIn addition to the \nparameters, you \ncan also set a Fin-\nish Delay, of \neither No-Delay \nor Wait-Until-\nDone.\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nAnnouncement\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done.\nAnnouncement\n\u2022\nSelected \nannouncement\nZone\n\u2022\nAll speakers\n\u2022\nSelected zone\nDuration\n\u2022\nNumber of \nseconds for \naction to con-\ntinue; default is \n86400 seconds \n(24 hours)\nNote: The \nannouncement \nwill stop when the \nduration length is \nreached, regard-\nless of the length \nof the announce-\nment.\nNone\nAudio-Dist-Start\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done\nAudio Distribution\n\u2022\nSelected Audio \nDistribution\nNone\nNone\nNone\n408\nAudio-Dist-Stop\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done\nAudio Distribution\n\u2022\nSelected Audio \nDistribution\n\u2022\nAll\nNone\nNone\nNone\nCall-And-\nAnnounce\nNumber to Call\n\u2022\n911\n\u2022\nStation Exten-\nsion\n\u2022\nA local 7-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 98\n\u2022\nA local 10-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 98\n\u2022\nA long dis-\ntance 10-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 981\nNote: If the speci-\nfied number to \ncall is not a station \nextension, then at \nleast one outgo-\ning SIP trunk or \nOutside Line \nDAHDI port must \nbe available, and \nthe CoS of the \nRoutine extension \nmust match the \nextension defined \nby the SIP trunk or \nOutside Line \nDAHDI port.\nAnnouncement to \nPlay\n\u2022\nSelected \nannouncement\nPlay Count\n\u2022\nContinuous \nPlay\n\u2022\nNumber of \ntimes to play\nNote: If left blank \nor set to zero (0), \nthe announce-\nment plays contin-\nuously until the \ncalled number \nhangs up.

In this example, \nNyquist automatically resizes the display message by decreasing the \nfont size if needed to better fit the message to the screen but will \nkeep the font size to at least 20. \nThe $alerts variable is also immediately followed by parameters in \nparentheses. The available parameters are:\n\u2022 AUTO_FIND_COUNTY. Automatically discovers the county code \nassociated with the Nyquist server\u2019s public IP address. \n\u2022 AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer>. Automatically compresses the \ndisplay message if the number of lines in the message exceeds the \n<Integer> value. For example, AUTO_COMPRESS_15 will cause \nmessages that contain more than 15 lines to be compressed by \nremoving end-of-line characters (lines will run together, separated \nby a space instead of end-of-line). The resulting message will per-\nhaps be more difficult to read than the original. Use this option if \nNote: The font size will automatically resize to 20 if the Alert mes-\nsage has these following parameters:\n\u2022 Priority is smaller than 6.\n\u2022 Text length is longer than 1500 characters.\n\u2022 The text has more than 500 capital letter characters.\nThe font size also automatically resizes to 20 if needed, even if the \n$auto_resize variable is not specified.\nNote: This option is not recommended if the server\u2019s physical \nlocation is in a different county from your facility, if your server \nresides in the cloud, or if you are tracking alerts for multiple facili-\nties and those facilities are not in the same county. Instead, find \nand use your county code.\n467\nyou want to ensure that messages will fit on the screen.

Instructions are usually obvious (like seek shelter, stay \nindoors, stay hydrated). However, instructions can be verbose and, \nwhile they can provide valuable information, verbose instructions \ncould cause the messages to be too large to display properly.\nNote: Font sizes are set in the Display Message options (see \"Cre-\nating a Display Message\u201d on page 438). For weather alerts, the fol-\nlowing settings are recommended for the Liberation Sans font:\n\u2022 30 - When not using the AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer> option \nof the $alerts variable and not using the $auto_resize variable. A \nfont size of 30 will ensure that the actual lines from the NWS \nwill fit on each line displayed.\n\u2022 65 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_15 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 40 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_25 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 70 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_<Inter> and $auto_resize \nvariable with display message priority of 6.\nNote: County codes are available at: https:\/\/alerts-v2.weather.gov\/\ncounties.\n468\n\u2022 REPEAT_<Integer>. Automatically repeats the alert processing \nand re-displays any resulting alerts every <Integer> seconds. Pre-\nvious alerts are automatically removed from displays. This option \nprovides a convenient way to check for and display alerts at a reg-\nular interval without having to create a routine loop and without \nhaving to worry about deleting previous or expired alerts.

This option allows you to replace a device, such as \nVoIP speaker, with a new device of the same type and maintain the \noriginal device\u2019s extension and configuration.\nYou can also use the New Stations option to replace an audio power \namplifier with another amplifier, regardless of type. For example, you \ncan replace an NQ-A2060 amplifier with an NQ-A2300 amplifier.\n3.4.2\nUsing a Cisco SPA112 Adapter\nThe Cisco SPA112 is an Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) that allows \nan analog phone to access IP phone services through two standard \ntelephone RJ-11 phone ports.\nThe following limitations exist when the Cisco SPA112 is used as a \nNyquist Admin Phone station:\n\u2022 Call queuing is not supported.\n\u2022 Call waiting is limited to one call. If the Admin Phone is associated \nwith an Admin Group, a call made to the Admin Phone when the \nphone is already on a call will automatically ring the Admin Group. \nIf the Admin Phone is not associated with an Admin Group and \n155\nreceives a call when already on a call, a beep sounds on the Admin \nPhone to indicate a call is on call waiting.\n\u2022 When you add two stations to an SPA112 device, you must enter \nthe same MAC address for both ports.\n\u2022 The station number with the lowest numerical value will be set up \non the first port (Phone 1) of the SPA112.\n\u2022 After you add or delete a second station to or from the SPA112, \nthe Nyquist system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist sys-\ntem server does not know the SPA112\u2019s IP address you must man-\nually reboot the SPA112 device for the changes to take effect on \nthe SPA112.\n\u2022 When a station is added to the SPA112, the web password is \nchanged to bogen. You can change the web password when add-\ning or editing the station.\n\u2022 If you configure two stations on the same SPA112, the web pass-\nword is set to the station with the highest station number, even if \nthe other station has a different web password defined. Ensure \nthat the same web password is entered for both stations on the \nSPA112.\n\u2022 When you delete the second station from the SPA112, the remain-\ning station is set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station \nwas previously set up on the second port (Phone 2). If this situa-\ntion occurs, move the attached phone cable from Phone 2 to \nPhone 1.\n\u2022 When you configure two stations on the same SPA112, the second \nstation (Phone 2) uses port # 5061.\n\u2022 It can take several minutes for changes to show up on the \nSPA112\u2019s web interface when adding, modifying, or deleting sta-\ntions to or from an SPA112.\n\u2022 When you add a station to an SPA 112 for the first time, you must \nreboot the SPA112 after adding the station with the Nyquist web \nUI before the SPA112 will retrieve its configuration information.\n\u2022 If station VLAN settings are provided and two stations are defined \non the SPA112, the VLAN settings from the station with the lowest \nstation number are used.

When the time is exceeded, the call switch or hand-\nset station is removed from the queue. Valid timeout values \nrange from 1 to 999 minutes.\nNight Ring Enabled\nIndicates if a night ring is enabled. When enabled, you can \noptionally set a Night Ring Admin and option set one \nadditional option from the following list:\n\u2022 Night Ring All Stations\n\u2022 Night Ring Admin Group\n\u2022 Night Ring Zones\n(For more information on night ring behavior, see \"Setting \nNight Call Options\u201d on page 31.)\nNight Ring Admin\nIdentifies the specific Admin Station that handles outside \nline calls received during night hours. Outside line calls not \nanswered with 15 seconds trigger ringing to all or selected \nstations. If Night Ring Admin is the only option set, then \nthe specified Admin extension rings for 30 minutes and \nhangs up if the call is not answered within that time. \nNote: If Night Admin is also included in the call, both \nNight Admin and Night Ring Admin ring. An analog \nphone cannot be used as a Night Ring Admin even if the \nstation has the admin Class of Service (CoS) enabled.\nNight Ring All Stations\nIndicates if all stations receive night rings during night \nhours. When enabled, any ringing station can answer the \ncall. The specified stations will ring for up to 30 minutes, \nthen hang up if the call is not answered within that time.\nNote: NQ-P0100 Matrix Mixer Pre-Amp stations will also \nring.\nNight Ring Admin \nGroup\nIdentifies the Admin Group that handles outside line calls \nreceived during night hours.

The specified stations \nwill ring for up to 30 minutes, then hang up if the call is not \nanswered within that time.\nServer IP Address\nIdentifies the server\u2019s IP address. To change the server\u2019s IP \naddress, select Change Server IP Address and then select \nthe correct IP address from the menu that appears.\nParking Lot\nDefines the range of numbers to use for call parking. The \nfirst number listed is used to initiate call parking, which is a \nfeature that allows you to put a call on hold at one tele-\nphone set and continue the conversation from any other \ntelephone set.\nRecord Monitoring\nIndicates if call and location monitoring will be recorded.\nEmergency Link\nSpecifies the station that functions as the system\u2019s Emer-\ngency Link Station. An Emergency Link Station is the station \nthat an emergency call (but not a 911 call) is routed to if the \nstation\u2019s associated Admin Station is busy, rejects the call, \nor fails to answer within 15 seconds. A value of 999 means \nthat this feature is disabled.\nIf the Emergency Link Station is a ringable device (a Nyquist \nphone), the station will ring and the call will be displayed \non the station\u2019s display (if so equipped) as an \u201cEmergency \nCall.\u201d If the Emergency Link Station is not a ringable device \n(a Nyquist VoIP speaker), the station will auto-answer, pre-\nannouncing the call as an \u201cEmergency.\u201d The Admin Station \nwill continue to ring if an emergency call is auto-answered \nby a non-ringable Emergency Link Station device. The \nAdmin Station can retrieve the call by answering it, and the \nEmergency Link Station device will then drop the call. As \nwith any Emergency Call, all calls to an Emergency Link Sta-\ntion will be recorded.\nMax Restricted Digits\nSpecifies the maximum number of digits that can be dialed \nif a station has been assigned restricted outside line access.\nCDR Storage Duration\nIdentifies the number of days that a record of call details \nwill be kept. CDR is an acronym for Call Detail Record.\nTrunk Priority\nIdentifies the first trunk type to use for placing outbound \ncalls.\nTable 2-1,  System Parameters Page (Continued)\n30\nBump on Emergency\nIndicates if emergency calls to the Admin Station will bump \nexisting non-emergency calls.\nBump on 911\nIndicates if outbound calls to 911 will bump trunk calls if no \navailable outbound trunk is available.\nAllow Local Emer-\ngency-All-Call Page \nInterrupt\nWhen enabled, allows an Emergency-All-Call page to be \ninterrupted after the user enters a PIN.\nAllow Multi-Site-Emer-\ngency-All-Call Inter-\nrupt\nWhen enabled, Emergency-All-Call pages can be inter-\nrupted by Multi-Site-Emergency-All-Call pages.\nAuth Code\nAllows you to enable additional features on a telephone \nwhen the walking CoS feature is enabled. The four-digit \ncode activates features from the associated phone to the \nphone being used. (Auth is an abbreviation for Authoriza-\ntion.) If set to 0000, the walking CoS feature is disabled.\nCall Assurance Audio\nIdentifies the audio to be played to the caller to indicate \nthat the call has been placed.\nRemote Facility CoS\nIdentifies the CoS for remote facility access.\nFacility Password\nIdentifies the password to be used by facility servers that \nare registering with this server. The maximum password size \nis 12 characters.\nRTP Start Port\nIdentifies the start port number for UDP RTP traffic. The \ndefault is 10000.\nRTP End Port\nIdentifies the stop port number for UDP RTP traffic. The \ndefault is 20000.\nEnable RTP Checksums\nIndicates if UDP checksums are enabled for RTP traffic.\nEnable ICE Support\nIndicates if ICE support is enabled.\nNote: Disabling ICE support could result in audio issues when making \ncalls using the Web Interface.\nSTUN Server\nIdentifies the host name or IP address for the STUN server \nthat is used when determining the external IP address and \nport for an RTP session. (Port number is optional.) If omit-\nted, the default value of 3478 is used.\nTable 2-1,  System Parameters Page (Continued)\n31\n2.1.1.2\nSetting Night Call Options\nThe way outside calls received during nighttime hours are handled \ndepends on how you set up the Night Ring options on the System \nParameters page. (See \"Using the System Parameters Page\u201d on \npage 24.) The following diagram illustrates how settings for these \noptions affect night calls.\nTURN Server\nIdentifies the host name or IP address for the TURN server \nthat is to be used as a relay. (Port number is optional.) If \nomitted, the default value of 3478 will be used.\nTURN Username\nIdentifies the user name used to authenticate with the \nTURN server.\nTURN Password\nIdentifies the password used to authenticate with the TURN \nserver.\nRetention Recordings\nIdentifies the number of days to retain recordings. Record-\nings that are older than the retention period are automati-\ncally deleted.\nBackup Retention \nSystem\nIdentifies the number of days to retain system backup files. \nSystem backups that are older than the retention period are \nautomatically deleted, provided at least one system backup \nfile remains.\nBackup Retention \nRecordings\nIdentifies the number of days that backups of recordings \nare retained. Backups that are older than the retention \nperiod are automatically deleted.\nBackup Retention \nVoicemail\nIdentifies the number of days that voicemail backups are \nretailed.
