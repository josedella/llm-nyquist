This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX \ndefined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.\nThe steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-\npoint for an IP-PBX are:\n1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone\/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-\ntem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone\/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, \nthe username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system \nwill attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint \nextension using the provided username (extension) and password \npair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to \naccess the Nyquist system.\n2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-\ntem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511.

This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX \ndefined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.\nThe steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-\npoint for an IP-PBX are:\n1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone\/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-\ntem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone\/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, \nthe username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system \nwill attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint \nextension using the provided username (extension) and password \npair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to \naccess the Nyquist system.\n2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-\ntem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX \nNote: The station extension used for the DISA Line must be differ-\nent than the extension being used by your IP-PBX.\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe table names that can be used in the Custom Settings format are ENDPOINT, AOR, AUTH, and SIPTRUNK.

In this example, \nNyquist automatically resizes the display message by decreasing the \nfont size if needed to better fit the message to the screen but will \nkeep the font size to at least 20. \nThe $alerts variable is also immediately followed by parameters in \nparentheses. The available parameters are:\n\u2022 AUTO_FIND_COUNTY. Automatically discovers the county code \nassociated with the Nyquist server\u2019s public IP address. \n\u2022 AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer>. Automatically compresses the \ndisplay message if the number of lines in the message exceeds the \n<Integer> value. For example, AUTO_COMPRESS_15 will cause \nmessages that contain more than 15 lines to be compressed by \nremoving end-of-line characters (lines will run together, separated \nby a space instead of end-of-line).

You may \nneed to experiment to determine a suitable value for <Integer>. \nYou can combine this option with the $auto_resize variable.\n\u2022 <County-Code>. Displays weather alerts for the specified county. \nFor example, the county code for Orange County, Florida, is \nFLC095.  \n\u2022 INCLUDE_CODES. Displays, the Severity, Certainty, Urgency and \nResponse codes on the Alerts header for each alert displayed on \nthe NQ-GA10PV display (see Figure 16-2, \u201cSample Alert With Ele-\nments Defined,\u201d on page 464).\n\u2022 INCLUDE_COUNTY. Displays the county code on the Alerts head-\ners. This is useful if you have several Alert related routines that use \ndifferent county codes.\n\u2022 INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS. Displays instructions that came with \nthe weather alerts. If you want to display the exact instructions \nprovided by the NWS, then add the INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS \noption. Instructions are usually obvious (like seek shelter, stay \nindoors, stay hydrated). However, instructions can be verbose and, \nwhile they can provide valuable information, verbose instructions \ncould cause the messages to be too large to display properly.\nNote: Font sizes are set in the Display Message options (see \"Cre-\nating a Display Message\u201d on page 438). For weather alerts, the fol-\nlowing settings are recommended for the Liberation Sans font:\n\u2022 30 - When not using the AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer> option \nof the $alerts variable and not using the $auto_resize variable. A \nfont size of 30 will ensure that the actual lines from the NWS \nwill fit on each line displayed.\n\u2022 65 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_15 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 40 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_25 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 70 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_<Inter> and $auto_resize \nvariable with display message priority of 6.\nNote: County codes are available at: https:\/\/alerts-v2.weather.gov\/\ncounties.\n468\n\u2022 REPEAT_<Integer>. Automatically repeats the alert processing \nand re-displays any resulting alerts every <Integer> seconds. Pre-\nvious alerts are automatically removed from displays. This option \nprovides a convenient way to check for and display alerts at a reg-\nular interval without having to create a routine loop and without \nhaving to worry about deleting previous or expired alerts. When \nthis option is used, no subsequent actions will be executed in the \nRoutine that executes the Display-Msg action. Since alert pro-\ncessing requires Internet access processing, Bogen recommends a \nminimum <Integer> value of 60 seconds. Using less than 60 sec-\nonds may significantly impact your network and Nyquist server \nprocessing utilization.\n\u2022 UPDATE_CACHE. Nyquist caches the found county code so the \nsystem does not have to search more than one time. \nIf your county code changes, you can include the option \nUPDATE_CACHE along with AUTO_FIND_COUNTY to have the \nsystem discover the county code and cache the new value. \nNote: You should delete the UPDATE_CACHE option after use; \notherwise, the Nyquist system searches for the county code each \ntime alerts are retrieved.\n469\nA sample alert string is:\n$alerts(FLC095,INCLUDE_CODES,AUTO_COMPRESS_15,REPEAT_60) \nThis string will display alerts for county code FLC095 (Orange County, \nFlorida) every 60 seconds including the Severity, Certainty, Urgency, \nand Repose codes, while automatically compressing alerts that have \nmore than 15 lines.\n16.4\nDemonstration Alerts\nSeveral demonstration, or sample, Alerts are available for display. \nThese samples represent typical alerts sent by the NWS for various \nalert types.\nYou can access these by replacing the <County-Code> with \nALERT_DEMO<number> where <number> is replaced with a number \nbetween 1 and 20 (for example, ALERT_DEMO10).

Use this option if \nNote: The font size will automatically resize to 20 if the Alert mes-\nsage has these following parameters:\n\u2022 Priority is smaller than 6.\n\u2022 Text length is longer than 1500 characters.\n\u2022 The text has more than 500 capital letter characters.\nThe font size also automatically resizes to 20 if needed, even if the \n$auto_resize variable is not specified.\nNote: This option is not recommended if the server\u2019s physical \nlocation is in a different county from your facility, if your server \nresides in the cloud, or if you are tracking alerts for multiple facili-\nties and those facilities are not in the same county. Instead, find \nand use your county code.\n467\nyou want to ensure that messages will fit on the screen. You may \nneed to experiment to determine a suitable value for <Integer>. \nYou can combine this option with the $auto_resize variable.\n\u2022 <County-Code>. Displays weather alerts for the specified county. \nFor example, the county code for Orange County, Florida, is \nFLC095.  \n\u2022 INCLUDE_CODES. Displays, the Severity, Certainty, Urgency and \nResponse codes on the Alerts header for each alert displayed on \nthe NQ-GA10PV display (see Figure 16-2, \u201cSample Alert With Ele-\nments Defined,\u201d on page 464).\n\u2022 INCLUDE_COUNTY. Displays the county code on the Alerts head-\ners. This is useful if you have several Alert related routines that use \ndifferent county codes.\n\u2022 INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS. Displays instructions that came with \nthe weather alerts. If you want to display the exact instructions \nprovided by the NWS, then add the INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS \noption. Instructions are usually obvious (like seek shelter, stay \nindoors, stay hydrated). However, instructions can be verbose and, \nwhile they can provide valuable information, verbose instructions \ncould cause the messages to be too large to display properly.\nNote: Font sizes are set in the Display Message options (see \"Cre-\nating a Display Message\u201d on page 438). For weather alerts, the fol-\nlowing settings are recommended for the Liberation Sans font:\n\u2022 30 - When not using the AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer> option \nof the $alerts variable and not using the $auto_resize variable. A \nfont size of 30 will ensure that the actual lines from the NWS \nwill fit on each line displayed.\n\u2022 65 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_15 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 40 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_25 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 70 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_<Inter> and $auto_resize \nvariable with display message priority of 6.\nNote: County codes are available at: https:\/\/alerts-v2.weather.gov\/\ncounties.\n468\n\u2022 REPEAT_<Integer>. Automatically repeats the alert processing \nand re-displays any resulting alerts every <Integer> seconds. Pre-\nvious alerts are automatically removed from displays. This option \nprovides a convenient way to check for and display alerts at a reg-\nular interval without having to create a routine loop and without \nhaving to worry about deleting previous or expired alerts. When \nthis option is used, no subsequent actions will be executed in the \nRoutine that executes the Display-Msg action. Since alert pro-\ncessing requires Internet access processing, Bogen recommends a \nminimum <Integer> value of 60 seconds. Using less than 60 sec-\nonds may significantly impact your network and Nyquist server \nprocessing utilization.\n\u2022 UPDATE_CACHE. Nyquist caches the found county code so the \nsystem does not have to search more than one time. \nIf your county code changes, you can include the option \nUPDATE_CACHE along with AUTO_FIND_COUNTY to have the \nsystem discover the county code and cache the new value. \nNote: You should delete the UPDATE_CACHE option after use; \notherwise, the Nyquist system searches for the county code each \ntime alerts are retrieved.\n469\nA sample alert string is:\n$alerts(FLC095,INCLUDE_CODES,AUTO_COMPRESS_15,REPEAT_60) \nThis string will display alerts for county code FLC095 (Orange County, \nFlorida) every 60 seconds including the Severity, Certainty, Urgency, \nand Repose codes, while automatically compressing alerts that have \nmore than 15 lines.\n16.4\nDemonstration Alerts\nSeveral demonstration, or sample, Alerts are available for display. \nThese samples represent typical alerts sent by the NWS for various \nalert types.\nYou can access these by replacing the <County-Code> with \nALERT_DEMO<number> where <number> is replaced with a number \nbetween 1 and 20 (for example, ALERT_DEMO10). Bogen recom-\nmends that you try each demonstration alert to get familiar with the \nalert format, the available $alerts options, and the font sizing.\nFigure 16-3, How Parameters Affect Display\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIf your county code changes while using the UPDATE_CACHE option, include the UPDATE_CACHE along with AUTO_FIND_COUNTY to discover and cache the new county code. After updating, you should delete the UPDATE_CACHE option to prevent the system from searching for the county code each time alerts are retrieved.<|eot_id|>","token_count":1412}

Cloning an action \ncreates a duplicate of the selected action and places the duplicate at \nthe end of the action list.\nYou can edit a cloned action if you want to change any of the param-\neters, such as duration.\nTo clone an action:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nSelect Actions for the routine that has the action you \nwant to clone.\nStep 3\nSelect the Clone button (\n) for the action that you \nwant to duplicate.\n13.11.5\nUnderstanding Action Parameters\nAn action can have up to four parameters, depending on the Type \nselected. \nWhen viewing actions, the parameters appear as Parameter 1, \nParameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action \npage, though, the parameter names and available selections change \nbased on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field \ncalled Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the \ntones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see \"Viewing Avail-\nable Tones\u201d on page 256). With this type of action, you can also set \nthe Duration, which appears on the Actions page as Parameter 3. \nParameters 2 and 4 are not used for this type of action, but you can \nset a Finish Delay, which establishes if the routine should wait until \nthis action is completed before starting the next action.\nSome actions have no parameters. For example, if you select All-Call \nfor Type, no parameters are applicable.\nThe following table describes the action Type and any applicable \nparameters.\n407\nTable 13-5, Action Types and Parameters\nType\nParameter 1\nParameter 2\nParameter 3\nParameter 4\nAlarm\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done.\nAlarm\n\u2022\nSelected alarm\nNone\nDuration\n\u2022\nNumber of \nseconds for \naction to con-\ntinue; default is \n86400 seconds \n(24 hours)\nNone\nAll-Call\nNote: All-Call \nmust be the last \naction in a routine.\nIn addition to the \nparameters, you \ncan also set a Fin-\nish Delay, of \neither No-Delay \nor Wait-Until-\nDone.\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nAnnouncement\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done.\nAnnouncement\n\u2022\nSelected \nannouncement\nZone\n\u2022\nAll speakers\n\u2022\nSelected zone\nDuration\n\u2022\nNumber of \nseconds for \naction to con-\ntinue; default is \n86400 seconds \n(24 hours)\nNote: The \nannouncement \nwill stop when the \nduration length is \nreached, regard-\nless of the length \nof the announce-\nment.\nNone\nAudio-Dist-Start\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done\nAudio Distribution\n\u2022\nSelected Audio \nDistribution\nNone\nNone\nNone\n408\nAudio-Dist-Stop\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done\nAudio Distribution\n\u2022\nSelected Audio \nDistribution\n\u2022\nAll\nNone\nNone\nNone\nCall-And-\nAnnounce\nNumber to Call\n\u2022\n911\n\u2022\nStation Exten-\nsion\n\u2022\nA local 7-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 98\n\u2022\nA local 10-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 98\n\u2022\nA long dis-\ntance 10-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 981\nNote: If the speci-\nfied number to \ncall is not a station \nextension, then at \nleast one outgo-\ning SIP trunk or \nOutside Line \nDAHDI port must \nbe available, and \nthe CoS of the \nRoutine extension \nmust match the \nextension defined \nby the SIP trunk or \nOutside Line \nDAHDI port.\nAnnouncement to \nPlay\n\u2022\nSelected \nannouncement\nPlay Count\n\u2022\nContinuous \nPlay\n\u2022\nNumber of \ntimes to play\nNote: If left blank \nor set to zero (0), \nthe announce-\nment plays contin-\nuously until the \ncalled number \nhangs up.

A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may \nhave multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before \na queue can be created.\nPage Queuing is designed to eliminate feedback that can occur if a \npage is made in an area where a microphone and speaker are in close \nproximity.

Changes should only be done after\nbusiness hours or during a small maintenance window\nthat does not exceed 5 minutes.\nWith the Page Queuing feature, you can record an unlimited number \nof pages or messages for queuing (stacking) for a specified zone or \nzones. A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may \nhave multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before \na queue can be created.\nPage Queuing is designed to eliminate feedback that can occur if a \npage is made in an area where a microphone and speaker are in close \nproximity. With page queuing, the page does not start until you (or \nthe user recording the page) has indicated that the recording is com-\npleted.\nPage Queuing also prevents page overlapping since pages sent to a \nqueue play one at a time.\nThe Page Queuing feature differs from the Schedule Announcement \n(see \"Using the Schedule Announcement Feature\u201d on page 239) and \nRecord Announcement (see \"Monitoring\/Recording\u201d on page 479) \nfeatures. The Schedule Announcement feature allows you to specify a \ndate and time when the announcement is to be played, and the \nDTMF Code *990 allows a user to use the admin phone to record an \nannouncement that is played immediately after it is recorded. \nUsing the DTMF Codes *991 or *991*{Zone Number} or selecting \nRecord Page from the Admin Phone or the Admin web UI allows you \nto initiate a queued page. \nWhen the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a zone \npage, Nyquist will start a queued page if the zone belongs to a \nqueue. If you want to start a real-time page to the zone instead, dial \n#{Zone Number}*.\nWith the Page Queuing feature, the recorded page is placed in a \nzone\u2019s queue. The pages in the zone\u2019s queue are played in the order \nthat they are placed in the queue.\nA live page started on a zone that is playing a recorded page will \ncause the recorded page to be terminated and sent back to the \nqueue.

The facility name and server time will not appear if the \nscreen is reduced in size, such as when viewing from a phone or tab-\nlet.\nIncoming Calls and Messages appear on the top right dashboard \npane. \nThe majority of the dashboard is set up to allow you to perform com-\nmunications activities, view this week\u2019s bell schedules, and perform \naudio distribution.\nThe navigation bar does not appear for those users not authorized to \nmake changes to the E7000 configuration. Instead, those users see \nonly common tasks, such as calling an extension.
