NQ-GA10P, NQ-GA10PV VoIP 
Intercom Module Installation 
and Use
The NQ-GA10P 
is a plenum rated 
Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP) 
intercom module 
that is designed 
for flexible installation and mounting options. 
The module features an integrated 10 watt power 
amplifier, an 8-ohm analog speaker connection, a 
dry-contact analog call switch input, a CAN Bus 
interface, and a Form C SPDT type 2-amp dry 
contact relay. 
The NQ-GA10PV 
model also features 
an HDMI video 
output. Designed 
to run on a 10/100 
Ethernet network, 
the NQ-GA10P and 
the NQ-GA10PV are IEEE 802.3af compliant and 
can be powered using Power-Over-Ethernet (PoE), 
or if that is not available, it can be powered via an 
optional 48VDC 15W power adapter.

The NQ-GA10P 

cord or plug is damaged, liquid has been spilled 
or objects have fallen into the apparatus, the 
apparatus has been exposed to rain or moisture, 
does not operate normally, or has been dropped.
Installation
To install the VoIP Intercom Module:
1.	 Attach the desired speakers and their associated 
call switches to the module using the pluggable 
connectors provided, where the 1 and 2 terminals 
connect to the +/- speaker wires and the “G” and 
“A” terminals connect to the asociated wires from 
the analog call switch. (See Fig. 1.)

=====
2.	 If using the NQ-GA10P/PV in an intercom 
talkback application, connect the speaker to the 
power amplifier’s 1 and 2 output and use either 
the NQ-E7020 or the CA-15C. (See Fig. 1.)
3.	 If the CAN Bus is to be used, ensure CAN_H and 
CAN_L use (Cat5 10/100) twisted pair cable.
4.	 Connect a Cat5 type cable into the module’s 
Ethernet port and ensure the other end of the 
cable is correctly connected to your network.
5.	 To connect a device to the Form C dry contact 
2A relay, do one of the following:
a. If the device is configured as normally open,
    connect to the device using the NO and 
    COM terminals. 
b. If the device is configured as normally
    closed, connect to the device using the NC
    and COM terminals.

6.	 If PoE is not available and your are using a 48V 
power supply, connect the Bogen PS48 15W 
power supply to the module.
7.	 If using the Bogen ANS500M ambient sound 
microphone, connect (-) on the ANS500M to Pin 
1 and (+) on the ANS500M to Pin 2. (See Fig. 2.)

Further configuration is done through the Nyquist  
Admin web-based user interface (UI). See the 
Nyquist System Administrator Manual.
8.	 If using the Bogen DDRU250 desktop microphone 
as a Push-to-Talk device, connect the microphone 
as shown in Fig. 3.

Viewing and Understanding LEDs of the The NQ-GA10P 

Two LEDs appear on the 
front of the module. One 
is labeled POWER and 
appears as solid red during 
initial power up, flashes 
green during a boot sequence, and appears solid 
green when fully booted.
The STATUS LED uses the following indicators to 
provide information about the module:
•	
Flashing red – No network connection found.
•	
Solid blue – The module is in an uninitialized 
state and is not associated to a Nyquist server. 
(The server may be in a discovery mode.)
•	
Solid red – The module needs to be rebooted or 
reset so that the Nyquist application can resume.
•	
Flashing blue – The module is updating.
•	
Solid green – The module is registered to a Nyquist server and is in normal operation.
•	
Flashing green – The module has an IP address 
but is not registered with the Nyquist server.
