NQ-A2060, NQ-A2120 
Audio Power Amplifiers
Installation and Use
These networked 
Audio Power Amplifiers 
support a full range 
of commercial paging 
and public address 
applications, regardless 
of the venue size.  Both 
the NQ-A2060 and the 
NQ-A2120 can operate 
in 2-channel mono or single channel bridged mode, depending 
on the application need.
Each networked audio power amplifier is a half-rack 1RU 
high enclosure containing a Class D audio power amplifier, 
a universal switched-mode power supply, an RJ45 network 
jack, a USB port, and pluggable Phoenix style terminals for 
loudspeaker and Line-Out connections.  Optionally, Line-Out 
can be connected using the available XLR connector.

reduce the risk 
of fire or electric 
shock, do not 
expose this 
apparatus to rain 
or moisture.
Always comply 
with the following 
basic safety precautions when installing and using the unit:
1.	 Read these instructions.
2.	 Keep these instructions.
3.	 Heed all warnings.
4.	 Follow all instructions.

6.	 DO NOT install near any heat sources such as 
radiators, heat registers, stoves, or other apparatus    
(including amplifiers) that produce heat.
7.	 DO NOT defeat the safety purpose of the polarized or 
grounding-type plug.  A polarized plug has two blades with 
one wider than the other.  A grounding-type plug has two 
blades and a third grounding prong. The wide blade, or the 
third prong, are provided for your safety. If the provided 
plug does not fit into your outlet, consult an electrician for 
replacement of the obsolete outlet.
8.	 Protect the power cord from being walked on and/or 
pinched, particularly at plugs, convenience receptacles, 
and the point where they exit from the apparatus.
 9.  Only use attachments/accessories that are specified by  
       the manufacturer.
10. Unplug this apparatus during lightning storms or when
       unused for long periods of time.
11. Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel. Servicing
      is required when the apparatus has been damaged in any
      way, such as power-supply cord or plug is damaged, liquid
      has been spilled or objects have fallen into the apparatus, 
      the apparatus has been exposed to rain or moisture, does 
      not operate normally, or has been dropped.

Installation
To install the NQ-A2060 Audio Power Amplifier:
1.	 Ensure the  POWER switch is in the off position.
2.	 Connect the universal mains power line cord into the 
amplifier.
3.	 Connect a Cat5 type cable into the amplifier’s Ethernet port 
and ensure the other end of the  cable is correctly connected 
to your network.
4.	 Set the Amplifier Mode switch to the desired setting.

This amplifier can be configured for single-channel bridged 
mode (aka bridged-tied load) operation for 70V/25V/8Ω 
applications, or 2-channel (mono) operation for 25V/8Ω/4Ω 
applications.  The Amplifier Mode switch is used in 
conjunction with the Bridged Signal routing setting in the 
system console.

WARNING:
The apparatus shall be connected to a mains socket 
outlet with
a protective earthing connection.
To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, do not ex­
pose this apparatus to rain or moisture.
The apparatus shall not be exposed to dripping or 
splashing and no objects filled with liquids, such as 
vases, shall be placed on the apparatus.
Where the mains plug or an appliance coupler is used 
as the disconnect device, the disconnect device shall 
remain readily operable.
=====
Bridged mode is typically used when higher power,  
single channel operation  with a high impedance 
loudspeaker load is desired. A typical use-case would 
be for 70V or 25V loudspeaker runs, where the total 
load is no less than 8Ω.

2 Channel mode is typically used for 8Ω or 4Ω 
loudspeakers runs. This mode allows the two amplifier 
channels to operate independently.
5.	 Connect the loudspeaker wires to the Amplifier 
Output Terminals, which are labeled A +/- and B +/-, 
as appropriate for the desired mode of operation (see 
Figures 1 and 2). 
Figure 1. Bridged Wiring Diagram
Bridged mode operation requires the speaker wires to 
be connected across a single, different terminal on each 
channel (A+ and B-). (See Figure 1.)

If two channel mode is used, then Channel A is connected to the 
A+ and A- terminals and B channel is connected to the B+ and 
B- terminals. (See Figure 2.)

Notice
The minimum impedance of a Bridged 70V/25V/8Ω High 
Impedance system should not be less than 8Ω. 
The minimum impedance of a 2CH 25V/8/4Ω system 
should not be less than 4Ω per channel.

=====
The combined total power of each speaker tap must not 
exceed 80% of the rated amplifier power in either Bridged 
70V/25V/8Ω mode or 2CH 25V/8/4Ω mode.
Failure to observe minimum speaker impedance will cause 
the amplifier to self protect until the speaker configuration 
is corrected.
6.	 If using Line Input, route the input. 

The amplifier uses a balanced line level (up to 2V RMS) ana­
log audio input. You can use either XLR or Phoenix (but not 
both) as the input.

This input can be routed to either or both amplifier channels, 
depending on the setting of the Amplifier Mode switch.
7.	 Plug the power line cord into the power source. 
8.	 Toggle the Power switch to the On position.
9.	 For information about configuring the amplifier for the 
Nyquist system, refer to the Nyquist Audio Power Amplifiers 
Configuration Manual.

Viewing and Understanding LEDs
Two LEDs appear on the front of the amplifier. One is labeled 
POWER and appears as solid red during initial power up, 
flashes green during a boot sequence, and appears solid green 
when fully booted.
The STATUS LED uses the following indicators to provide 
information about the appliance:
•	
Flashing red – No network connection found.
•	
Solid blue – The amplifier is in an uninitialized state and is 
not associated to a server. (The server may be in a discovery 
mode.)
•	
Solid green – The 
amplifier is registered to 
a Nyquist server and is in 
normal operation.
•	
Flashing green – The 
amplifier has an IP 
address but is not 
registered with the 
Nyquist server.
•	
Solid red – The amplifier needs to be rebooted or reset so 
that the Nyquist application can resume.
•	
Flashing blue – The amplifier is updating.
Clipping, Protection, and Temperature Indicators
In addition to the LEDs that appear on the actual appliance, 
separate amplifier module signal clipping, protection mode, 
and temperature status indicators appear in the Nyquist

Using the Reset Button
The Reset button allows you to restart the appliance or to reset 
the appliance’s configuration settings to the factory default 
settings. For more information about resetting configuration 
settings, refer to the Nyquist Audio Power Amplifiers
