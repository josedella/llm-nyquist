Audio Power 
Amplifiers
Installation 
and Use
The Nyquist Power 
Amplifiers decode audio content distributed by the Nyquist 
application and levels for loudspeaker drive. The amplifiers act 
as paging and public address endpoints for any source on the 
network.
Each networked audio power amplifier is a 2RU high enclosure 
containing four Class D audio power amplifier channels, 
a universal switched-mode power supply, a USB port, one 
RJ45 network jack, and pluggable Phoenix style terminals 
for both low and high impedance loudspeakers and Line-Out 
connections.  Optionally, the Line-Out can be connected using 
the available XLR connector.
WARNING: To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, do not 
expose this apparatus to rain or moisture.

Installation
To install the Power Amplifier:
1.	 Ensure the  POWER switch is in the off position.
2.	 Connect the universal mains power line cord into the amplifier.
3.	 Connect a Cat5 type cable into the amplifier’s Ethernet port 
and ensure the other end of the  cable is correctly connected 
to your network.
4.	 Set the Amplifier Mode switch to either 70/25V 8Ω (Bridged), 
or 25V, 8Ω or 4Ω (2 Channel mode). The default is 2 Channel 
mode.

Bridged mode is typically used when higher power, single 
channel operation with a high impedance loudspeaker 
load is desired. A typical use-case would be for 70V or 25V 
loudspeaker runs, where the total load is no less than 8Ω.

2 Channel mode is typically used for 8Ω or 4Ω loudspeakers 
or 25V loudspeaker runs. This mode allows the two amplifier 
channels to run independently.
5.	 Connect the loudspeaker wires to the Amplifier Output 
Terminals, which are labeled A +/-, B +/-, C+/-, and D+/-, as 
appropriate for the desire mode of operation (see Figures 1 
& 2.). 

Bridged mode operation requires the speaker wires to 
be connected across a single, different terminal on each 
channel (A+ and B- and/or C+ and D-). (See Figure 1.) If two 
channel mode is used, then Channel A is connected to A+ and 
A- terminals, Channel B is connected to B+ and B- terminals, 
Channel C is connected to C+ and C- terminals, and Channel D 
is connected to D+ and D- terminals. (See Figure 2.)

Notice
Failure to observe minimum speaker impedance will cause 
the amplifier to self protect until the speaker configuration 
is corrected.
6.	 If using the Line Input, you can route the signal to any paging 
zone or station.

This balanced line level input can accept analog inputs up to 
2V RMS. You can use either XLR or Phoenix (but not both) 
as the input.
7.	 Plug the power line cord into the power source. 
8.	 Toggle the Power switch to the On position.
For information about configuring the amplifier for the Nyquist 
system, refer to the Nyquist Power Amplifiers Configuration 
Manual.
Power Ratings
The NQ-A4300 can provide 300 Watts by four channels (A, B, 
C, and D) into 25V, 8Ω, or 4Ω loads, or 600 Watts Bridged (two 
channels – A+B Bridged and/or C+D Bridged) into 70V, 25V, or 
8Ω load configurations.
The NQ-A4120 can provide 120 Watts by four channels (A, B, 
C, and D) into 25V, 8Ω, or 4Ω loads, or 120 Watts Bridged (two 
channels – A+B Bridged and/or C+D Bridged) into 70V, 25V, or 
8Ω load configurations.
The NQ-A4060 can provide 60 Watts by four channels (A, B, 
C, and D) into 25V, 8Ω, or 4Ω loads, or 120 Watts Bridged (two 
channels – A+B Bridged and/or C+D Bridged) into 70V, 25V, or 
8Ω load configurations.

Viewing and 
Understanding LEDs
Two LEDs appear on the front of the 
amplifier. One is labeled POWER 
and appears as solid red during initial 
power up, flashes green during a boot 
sequence, and appears solid green 
when fully booted.
The STATUS LED uses the following 
indicators to provide information 
about the appliance:
•	
Flashing red – No network connection found.
•	
Solid blue – The amplifier is in an uninitialized 
state and is not associated 
to a server. (The server may be 
in a discovery mode.)
•	
Solid green – The amplifier is registered to a Nyquist server 
and is in normal operation.
•	
Flashing green – The amplifier has an IP address but is not 
registered with the Nyquist server.
•	
Solid red – The amplifier needs to be rebooted or reset so 
that the Nyquist application can resume.
•	
Flashing blue – The amplifier is updating.

Clipping, Protection, and Temperature Indicators
In addition to the LEDs that appear on the actual appliance, 
separate amplifier module signal clipping, protection mode, 
and temperature status indicators appear in the Nyquist 
amplifier’s web-based user interface. For more information 
about these status indicators, refer to the Nyquist Audio Power 
Amplifiers Configuration Manual.
Using the Reset Button

The Reset button allows you to 
restart the appliance or to reset 
the appliance’s configuration 
settings to the factory default 
settings. For more information 
about resetting configuration 
settings, refer to the Nyquist 
Audio Power Amplifiers 
Configuration Manual.
