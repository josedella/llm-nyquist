Introducing the E7000 Series
E7000 is an IP network based intercom and paging solution that 
allows you to:
• Control facility bell schedules, announcements, and tones.
• Create and manage zones and queues. 
• Manage station types, configuration, and Class of Service (CoS). 
• Manage users, roles, and permissions.
• Create routines that can be manually started or that automatically 
launch procedures, or sequences of actions, that the Nyquist sys-
tem executes as a result of input triggers. 
• Monitor check-in status of classrooms or other areas during an 
emergency event, such as a lockdown or evacuation.
E7000 simplifies routine and emergency network communications 
and allows the linking of administrative and staff locations within a 
single building, among multiple buildings throughout a campus, or 
across the entire district. 
E7000 features a built-in streaming Internet radio service – airable by 
TuneIn, and optional custom-tailored music selections from SOUND-
MACHINE, the premier music subscription service for business. Both

tasks, that you can perform if you are assigned an Admin role with 
proper permissions and if your station Type is an Admin Web 
Interface. If you are assigned a User role and your station’s Type is 
Web Interface, refer to the Non-Admin Web Interface User Guide 
and to "Performing Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 293 of this

services can be used to schedule audio to play at specific times, such 
as when classes are changing.
Available feature-rich IP phones and purpose-built networked appli-
ances provide convenient communication, control, and interoperabil-
ity with third-party devices and systems such as access control, fire 
alarm, clock, and PBX systems.
The E7000 system supports the following hardware:
• Personal Computers (PCs), tablets, and Android and Windows 
mobile phones that support the full Google Chrome web browser 
to access the E7000 Admin Web user interface (UI) and the E7000 
Web UI (User Dashboard)
• E7000 certified Voice over IP (VoIP) phones
• Nyquist appliances

Understanding System Requirements
The E7000 web-based UI requires a secure Hypertext Transfer Proto-
col Secure (https) type network connection to the E7000 system 
server. Users can log in to the E7000 system using the Google 
Chrome web browser from a computer or tablet running either a 
Windows 8.1 (or later) or a Mac OS X 10.12.x (or later) operating 
system (OS). The UI can also be accessed via a Chrome browser 
enabled Android-based tablet or mobile device. To access the server, 
type your server’s IP address (for example, 10.10.20.12).
1.1.1
Whitelisted Web Addresses
E7000 requires access to specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), 
commonly referred to as web addresses. Access to many of these 
web addresses is required during installation; access to other web 
addresses, such as the address for the Network Time Server (NTS) are 
required during runtime. The Information Technology (IT) depart-
ment for the site must whitelist the web addresses so that they can 
be easily accessed as needed.
The following table lists the URLs that must be whitelisted.

The web-based UI is accessed through a client, which can run on PCs, 
tablets, and Android and Windows mobile phones that support the 
full Google Chrome web browser. In addition to supporting Chrome, 
the client must have a sound card with a microphone port and a 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, which is also known as a digital 
certificate. The SSL certificate authenticates the identity of the E7000 
website and encrypts the data that is transmitted from the client to 
the server. If you do not install the SSL certificate, a lock with a red x 
appears when you attempt to access the E7000 system server.

The dashboard that appears depends on whether your station is an 
Admin Web Interface or a non-administrator Web Interface.
If you are using the Admin Web Interface and have permissions for 
configuration tasks, your dashboard will appear like that in Figure 1-
4, E7000 Dashboard for Admin Web Interface. 
Figure 1-3,  Login Page
14
If you are logged in as a user and using the non-administrator Web 
Interface station Type, the dashboard will look like Figure 1-5, Non-
Administrator Web Interface.
Figure 1-4,  E7000 Dashboard for Admin Web Interface
Note: This manual describes the tasks, including configuration 
tasks, that you can perform if you are assigned an Admin role with 
proper permissions and if your station Type is an Admin Web 
Interface. If you are assigned a user role and your station’s Type is 
Web Interface, refer to the Non-Admin Web Interface User Guide 
and to "Performing Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 of this 
manual. For information about station types, see "Managing Sta-
tions, Zones, and Queues” on page 105. For information about 
roles, see "Managing Roles and Users” on page 199.

The left side, or navigation bar, of the dashboard, lists the areas of the 
E7000 system that you can access. Accessibility to E7000 features and 
functionality is controlled by the user’s assigned role.
The right header ribbon provides the facility name, server time in 
hours and minutes, the username for the account and the extension 
for the station. The facility name and server time will not appear if the 
screen is reduced in size, such as when viewing from a phone or tab-
let.
Incoming Calls and Messages appear on the top right dashboard 
pane. 
The majority of the dashboard is set up to allow you to perform com-
munications activities, view this week’s bell schedules, and perform 
audio distribution.
The navigation bar does not appear for those users not authorized to 
make changes to the E7000 configuration. Instead, those users see 
only common tasks, such as calling an extension. See "Performing 
Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 for details about tasks that 
office and teaching staff commonly perform. Chapter 9 of this 
manual can be distributed by itself to front office staff.
At the top of the dashboard, messages appear that can provide infor-
mation about your system, such as any stations or devices that were 
connected to your server but now are not appearing to be connected 
or responding. (See "Dashboard Messages” on page 324.)
If the dashboard message “System is running in demonstration 
mode” appears, all E7000 functions are enabled but the maximum 
station count is set to 6 and the maximum number of simultaneous 
calls is set to 2.
If an I/O Controller rule’s Action has been set to Manual, a dash-
board button appears that can be used to manually close or open 
specified output contact. (See "Viewing I/O Controller Configuration 
Rules” on page 120.)
On the lower part of the dashboard are options for Audio Distribu-
tion and an Enable/Disable Audio button that you can toggle to 
enable or disable audio.

Configuring E7000
After E7000 is installed on your server, you must configure your 
system and the E7000 features to best suit your organizational needs. 
For example, you must determine if your E7000 server is being used 
for just your school or for a multi-school campus environment. An 
example of a multi-school campus environment is when a middle 
school and a high school are on the same campus.
The following table provides the suggested order for setting up your 
system and directs you to specific sections of the E7000 documenta-
tion for step by step instructions.
Note: If an E7000 system server is used in a multi-school campus 
environment, All-Call and Emergency All-Call pages broadcast at 
all schools managed by that E7000 system server. If you do not 
want this setup, then each school on the campus should have its 
own E7000 system server. A single E7000 system server should not 
be used to manage multiple schools that are geographically sepa-
rated since WLAN and power issues at one school could disrupt 
E7000 service at all locations.

can be up to 30 characters.
Day Start
Identifies when the system switches to its “Day” mode of 
operation and specifies the time period for which the day 
Admin Station is active. Telephones with night-only outside 
line access are prevented from placing outside line calls 
during this time. Valid times range from 00:00 to 23:58, but 
must be less than the Night Start time.
Night Start
Identifies when the system switches to its “Night” mode of 
operation and specifies the time period for which the night 
Admin Station is active. During this time, telephones with 
the night-only outside line access can place outside line 
calls. Valid times range from 00:01 to 23:59; but must be 
larger than the Day Start time.
Emergency-All-Call 
Multicast RTP IP 
Address
Identifies the IP address to use for multicast RTP paging for 
Emergency-All-Call. Receiving IP telephones must also have 
this IP address configured. Emergency all-call is a top prior-
ity all-call page. An all-call page is a simultaneous page to 
all speakers within a facility.

Emergency Link
Specifies the station that functions as the system’s Emer-
gency Link Station. An Emergency Link Station is the station 
that an emergency call (but not a 911 call) is routed to if the 
station’s associated Admin Station is busy, rejects the call, 
or fails to answer within 15 seconds. A value of 999 means 
that this feature is disabled.
If the Emergency Link Station is a ringable device (a Nyquist 
phone), the station will ring and the call will be displayed 
on the station’s display (if so equipped) as an “Emergency 
Call.” If the Emergency Link Station is not a ringable device 
(a Nyquist VoIP speaker), the station will auto-answer, pre-
announcing the call as an “Emergency.” The Admin Station 
will continue to ring if an emergency call is auto-answered 
by a non-ringable Emergency Link Station device. The 
Admin Station can retrieve the call by answering it, and the 
Emergency Link Station device will then drop the call. As 
with any Emergency Call, all calls to an Emergency Link Sta-
tion will be recorded.

Managing SIP Trunks
A SIP trunk is an IP based network connection between Nyquist and 
an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP), which is also known as 
a VoIP telephone service provider. It allows you to use VoIP tele-
phony beyond the facility’s firewall without the need for a Public 
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), providing a configuration that 
is easier and less expensive to operate and maintain. SIP trunks can 
carry VoIP calls, Enhanced 911, and other real-time communications 
services. 
A SIP Tie-Trunk (or a SIP Tie-Line) functions similarly to a SIP trunk, 
but serves as an IP based inter-connection between Nyquist and a 
local (premises-based) or hosted IP-PBX. For information about using 
SIP Tie-Trunks with Nyquist, refer to "SIP Trunk Custom Configuration 
Settings” on page 75.
Before you can set SIP parameters in Nyquist, you must first set up 
the system's DISA function by creating a station with the Type of 
DISA Line. (See "Adding a Station” on page 153.)
If you will require support from Bogen during the implementation 
process, you must install Teamviewer on the Nyquist system server 
and enable Remote access capabilities in the LAN to allow a remote 
connection to the server. In addition, Wireshark must be installed in 
the Nyquist system server to allow packet inspection during SIP 
implementation and troubleshooting. It is recommended that the 
technician performing the install be skilled with SIP implementation 
and testing. The Firewall setting must allow Port 5060 and Ports 
10000 – 20000 for the RTP traffic. Any other type of SIP connectivity 
could be available via an individual case basis process.

2.3.1
How Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls
When a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on 
that SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter 
set in the Nyquist SIP trunk’s parameters. The Access parameter is set 
when editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see "Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 and "Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-
tion.
Based on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-
lowing:
• Routes the call to a DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
DISA functionality:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• DISA – Incoming only – No password
• DISA – Incoming only – Password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password
When the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will 
hear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any 
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a 
Nyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller 
can dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See "Nyquist 
DTMF Feature Dialing Codes” on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)
When incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk 
Extension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type 
DISA Line; the associated station’s CoS configuration is used to 
determine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed 
to initiate. (See "Adding CoS Parameters for a Station” on page 67.) 
Note: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-
tem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are 
ignored.

2.3.1
How Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls
When a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on 
that SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter 
set in the Nyquist SIP trunk’s parameters. The Access parameter is set 
when editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see "Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 and "Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-
tion.
Based on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-
lowing:
• Routes the call to a DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
DISA functionality:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• DISA – Incoming only – No password
• DISA – Incoming only – Password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password
When the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will 
hear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any 
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a 
Nyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller 
can dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See "Nyquist 
DTMF Feature Dialing Codes” on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)
When incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk 
Extension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type 
DISA Line; the associated station’s CoS configuration is used to 
determine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed 
to initiate. (See "Adding CoS Parameters for a Station” on page 67.) 
Note: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-
tem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are 
ignored.
69
The Extension parameter is also used as the caller ID when a DISA 
user dials a station extension.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to 
Security DISA functionality:
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Security DISA – Incoming – Listen only
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, security DISA
The caller must enter a valid extension to be monitored and can only 
listen to calls or station locations.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
defined Day or Night Admin:
• Unrestricted
• Incoming Only
If the Day or Night Admin does not answer the incoming call, the call 
is routed, or rolled over, to the Admin Group. (See "Using Admin 
Groups” on page 211.) 
If the call is not answered during night hours and the Night Ring 
option is enabled, the call is routed using the Night Ring functional-
ity. (See "Setting Night Call Options” on page 31.) 
2.3.2
How Nyquist Handles Outgoing SIP Calls
Nyquist users can initiate outside calls by dialing a number that starts 
with the outside call prefix (98). Outside calls are only sent to SIP 
Trunks that have one of the following Access settings:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No Password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Unrestricted
• Outgoing Only
Note: Use the PBX Connection options only if the PBX accepts 7-
digit and 10-digit domestic and 12digit international PSTN tele-
phone numbers and can initiate outbound calls to specified tele-
phone numbers.
=====

69
The Extension parameter is also used as the caller ID when a DISA 
user dials a station extension.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to 
Security DISA functionality:
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Security DISA – Incoming – Listen only
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, security DISA
The caller must enter a valid extension to be monitored and can only 
listen to calls or station locations.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
defined Day or Night Admin:
• Unrestricted
• Incoming Only
If the Day or Night Admin does not answer the incoming call, the call 
is routed, or rolled over, to the Admin Group. (See "Using Admin 
Groups” on page 211.) 
If the call is not answered during night hours and the Night Ring 
option is enabled, the call is routed using the Night Ring functional-
ity. (See "Setting Night Call Options” on page 31.) 
2.3.2
How Nyquist Handles Outgoing SIP Calls
Nyquist users can initiate outside calls by dialing a number that starts 
with the outside call prefix (98). Outside calls are only sent to SIP 
Trunks that have one of the following Access settings:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No Password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Unrestricted
• Outgoing Only
Note: Use the PBX Connection options only if the PBX accepts 7-
digit and 10-digit domestic and 12digit international PSTN tele-
phone numbers and can initiate outbound calls to specified tele-
phone numbers.
70
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, No DISA 
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, Password
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Security DISA
When outside calls are placed, the outbound caller ID is set to the 
Direct Inward Dial (DID) defined for the SIP Trunk. (See "Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 or "Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72.)
When Access is set to 911 Only, only outgoing 911 calls may be 
routed on the associated SIP trunk. The DID parameter is not used 
for outgoing 911 calls; it is expected that the SIP trunk provider has 
mapped the Billing Telephone Number (BTN) to E911 service.
All outgoing calls are routed through the SIP trunk provider using the 
following SIP trunk configuration parameters:
• Host IP Address
• Username
• Password
If the SIP trunk provider expects all called numbers to be prefixed 
with a specific code, the Dial Prefix setting can be used to satisfy the 
requirement.
If the SIP trunk provider expects all called 7-digit numbers to be pre-
fixed with a specific local area code, the Local Area Code setting can 
be used to satisfy the requirement. (See "Adding SIP Trunk Configura-
tion Parameters” on page 72.)
2.3.3
Configuring SIP Tie-Trunks Between Nyquist 
and PBX Systems
If you want all incoming calls from the PBX to always use DISA to 
prompt the user for Nyquist dial codes, then use one of the Access 
options that starts with DISA (for example, DISA – Incoming only - 
No password).
If you want all incoming calls from the PBX to directly pass in dial 
codes that have already been collected from the user by the PBX or 
created by the PBX, then choose one of the Access options that starts
=====


70
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, No DISA 
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, Password
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Security DISA
When outside calls are placed, the outbound caller ID is set to the 
Direct Inward Dial (DID) defined for the SIP Trunk. (See "Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 or "Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72.)
When Access is set to 911 Only, only outgoing 911 calls may be 
routed on the associated SIP trunk. The DID parameter is not used 
for outgoing 911 calls; it is expected that the SIP trunk provider has 
mapped the Billing Telephone Number (BTN) to E911 service.
All outgoing calls are routed through the SIP trunk provider using the 
following SIP trunk configuration parameters:
• Host IP Address
• Username
• Password
If the SIP trunk provider expects all called numbers to be prefixed 
with a specific code, the Dial Prefix setting can be used to satisfy the 
requirement.
If the SIP trunk provider expects all called 7-digit numbers to be pre-
fixed with a specific local area code, the Local Area Code setting can 
be used to satisfy the requirement. (See "Adding SIP Trunk Configura-
tion Parameters” on page 72.)
2.3.3
Configuring SIP Tie-Trunks Between Nyquist 
and PBX Systems
If you want all incoming calls from the PBX to always use DISA to 
prompt the user for Nyquist dial codes, then use one of the Access 
options that starts with DISA (for example, DISA – Incoming only - 
No password).
If you want all incoming calls from the PBX to directly pass in dial 
codes that have already been collected from the user by the PBX or 
created by the PBX, then choose one of the Access options that starts 
71
with PBX Connection (for example, PBX Connection – Incoming 
only, Allow DISA, No password).
When any of the following Access options are configured for the SIP 
Tie-Trunk, the Nyquist server expects that dialing digits are provided 
by the PBX system (the dialing digits should be included in the SIP 
INVITE from the PBX), and Nyquist will immediately initiate a Nyquist 
call based on the digits provided:
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, No DISA
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, Allow DISA, Password
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, No DISA
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, Password
If the PBX Connection option includes Allow DISA, the PBX may start 
the DISA function by sending dialing code 950. The DISA function will 
also be started if the PBX does not pass any dialing digits in the SIP 
INVITE.
If PBX Connection – Incoming only, No DISA is used, the SIP Trunk 
must still have a DISA station type linked to the SIP trunk extension to 
provide the Nyquist CoS settings to be used for incoming calls, but 
when incoming connections are made from the PBX, the Nyquist 
system will ignore dialing code 950. The DISA function cannot be 
requested if the No DISA option is used.
The dialing digits provided by the PBX can be any of the DTMF codes 
supported by the Nyquist system. Access to various Nyquist features 
is granted based on the Nyquist CoS settings of the DISA station 
extension defined in the SIP Trunk.
If the PBX is not able to pass through # in the dialing digits, alternate 
dialing codes may be used to replace Nyquist extensions that start 
with #. The following table describes the alternate dialing codes:

When the following Access options are configured for the SIP Tie-
Trunk, upon connection from the PBX system (via SIP INVITE), the 
Nyquist system automatically activates the Security DISA function:
• PBX Connection - Incoming only, security DISA
• PBX Connection - Bi-directional, Security DISA
The caller must enter an access PIN, followed by the extension 
number of the station that he wants to monitor:

Registering as a Third-Party SIP Endpoint
You can configure a Nyquist SIP trunk to register with a third-party 
SIP endpoint with an IP-PBX. This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX 
defined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.
The steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-
point for an IP-PBX are:
1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-
tem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-
point as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone 
with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the 
SIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk 
must use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the 
Add SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a 
DISA station. 
When an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-
ing call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-
sion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the 
Nyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to 
initiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX 
Note: The station extension used for the DISA Line must be differ-
ent than the extension being used by your IP-PBX.

with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the 
SIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk 
must use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the 
Add SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a 
DISA station. 
When an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-
ing call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-
sion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the 
Nyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to 
initiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX

Figure 2-24, Facility Decision Chart
99
Any connected facility can perform multi-site paging (paging to all 
facilities listed in the Facilities list) provided the facility has at least 
one station with the necessary CoS permissions enabled. If you are 
using an Admin Phone with the correct CoS permissions enabled, you 
can dial specific DTMF codes to perform various activities.
The following table provides a list of CoS permissions required and 
DTMF codes used for specific activities.
For information about Facility Error Conditions, see "Facility Error 
Conditions” on page 328.
Your Nyquist network can use multiple servers that all have the same 
password, or you can set different passwords for each server.

3 Managing Stations, 
Zones, and Queues
105
Managing Stations, Zones, and 
Queues
You can divide your facility into zones to control paging and audio 
activities or features. For example, suppose you want to allow the use 
of an audio source, such as a flash drive, in a cafeteria but prevent it 
from being played in a conference room. This feature, called audio 
distribution, can be turned on by zone, so the cafeteria could be 
placed in a zone that allows audio distribution while conference 
rooms would not be placed into that zone.
No limit exists for the number of zones or for the number of stations 
that can be in a multicast zone. Performance limits do exist for unicast 
connections. The station limit for your system is determined by your 
license (see "NQ-E7000SSL – Nyquist E7000 System Station License” 
on page 486).
With the Page Queuing feature, you can record an unlimited number 
of pages or messages for queuing (stacking) for a specified zone or 
zones. A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may 
have multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before 
a queue can be created.
A station can be in multiple zones.
An E7000 station is: 
• A device used to access the web interface
• A speaker
• A phone 
• A Nyquist appliance
Note: For licensing purposes, an I/O Controller is not counted as a 
station.

Table 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor Parameters
Station
Displays the extension number of the station 
that is an ANS Listener. A station can only lis-
ten to one ANS.
Max Boost (dB)
Displays the maximum dB gain adjustment 
allowed. Setting this parameter to 0 disables 
any volume adjustments from the ambient 
noise sensor. The default value is 20 dB.
Threshold (dBFS)
Displays the decibels relative to full scale 
(dBFS) value at which point the device will 
adjust the volume to compensate for the 
increased ambient noise volume. This value 
should be between -40 and 0 dBFS. A fairly 
noisy environment is around -20 dBFS; quiet 
environments are in the range of -40 dBFS. 
The default value is -20 dBFS.
Volume Adjust 
(dB)
Displays the amount of decibels to stay 
above the ambient noise level. Setting this to 
0 disables any volume adjustments from the 
ANS. The default value is 12 dB.
Sample Length(s) 
Displays the ambient noise sampling length, 
which can range from 1 to 20 seconds. Short 
lengths provide quicker response to changes 
in the ambient noise; longer lengths will 
ignore sudden, short fluctuations in the 
ambient noise.

associations that the Admin Station has (for example, member of Day 
Admin, Night Admin, Night Ring, or Admin Group). 
After you delete a second station from an SPA112, the Nyquist 
system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist system server does 
not know the SPA112's IP Address, you must reboot the SPA112 
device for the changes to take effect on the SPA112. 
When a station is deleted from an SPA112, it can take several minutes 
for the changes to show up on the SPA112's web interface. When the 
second station is deleted from the SPA112, the remaining station is 
set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station was previously 
set up on the second port (Phone 2). If this situation occurs, move the 
attached phone cable from Phone 2 to Phone 1.

Adding a Station
Using the Nyquist system server’s automatic discovery feature is the 
preferred method of adding a station. If you manually add a station, 
you risk having the MAC address entered incorrectly, which would 
prevent the station from functioning properly.
If the station Type is Admin Web Interface, Admin Phone, IP Phone, 
Analog Phone, or Mobile Device, you can set a default Announce-
ment Zone and the Announcement Zone Configuration Type. If 
the Announcement Zone Configuration Type is set to Fixed, the 
zone used to play announcements will always be the zone number 
provided for Announcement Zone and cannot be changed. If set to 
Default, the Announcement Zone value is used as the default zone, 
but you can set an announcement to play to another zone.

If the Admin Phone is not associated with an Admin Group and 
155
receives a call when already on a call, a beep sounds on the Admin 
Phone to indicate a call is on call waiting.
• When you add two stations to an SPA112 device, you must enter 
the same MAC address for both ports.
• The station number with the lowest numerical value will be set up 
on the first port (Phone 1) of the SPA112.
• After you add or delete a second station to or from the SPA112, 
the Nyquist system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist sys-
tem server does not know the SPA112’s IP address you must man-
ually reboot the SPA112 device for the changes to take effect on 
the SPA112.
• When a station is added to the SPA112, the web password is 
changed to bogen. You can change the web password when add-
ing or editing the station.
• If you configure two stations on the same SPA112, the web pass-
word is set to the station with the highest station number, even if 
the other station has a different web password defined. Ensure 
that the same web password is entered for both stations on the 
SPA112.
• When you delete the second station from the SPA112, the remain-
ing station is set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station 
was previously set up on the second port (Phone 2). If this situa-
tion occurs, move the attached phone cable from Phone 2 to 
Phone 1.
• When you configure two stations on the same SPA112, the second 
station (Phone 2) uses port # 5061.
• It can take several minutes for changes to show up on the 
SPA112’s web interface when adding, modifying, or deleting sta-
tions to or from an SPA112.
• When you add a station to an SPA 112 for the first time, you must 
reboot the SPA112 after adding the station with the Nyquist web 
UI before the SPA112 will retrieve its configuration information.
• If station VLAN settings are provided and two stations are defined 
on the SPA112, the VLAN settings from the station with the lowest 
station number are used. The best practice is to ensure that both 
stations on the SPA112 use the same VLAN settings.

Adding a Station that Uses a Yeastar TA2400 Port
To add a station that uses a Yeastar TA2400 port to your Nyquist sys-
tem, follow the procedures for adding a station (See "Adding a Sta-
tion” on page 153). 
When you select Yeastar-TA2400 Analog FXS Port as the Device 
Type, you must select the Port Number that the station is attached 
to from the drop-down list. Valid values are 1 through 24. 
If you have only one phone attached to the TA2400, it must be 
attached to port 1. If you have multiple phones attached to the 
TA2400, one must be attached to port 1 but the use of the other 
ports can be random. For example, you can have phones attached to 
port 1, 2, 5, and 10. However, you cannot attach phones to just ports 
2, 5, and 10 since that combination does not include phone 1.
The following rules apply when adding a station to a Yeastar TA2400 
port:
• Device Type is Yeastar-TA2400 Analog FXS Port.
• You can select Admin Phone or IP Phone for Type.
• MAC Address is a required field. If you are adding the first station 
for this MAC Address, the Port Number is automatically set to 1.
• Paging is set to No and cannot be changed.
• Multicast Audio Distribution is set to No but does not appear 
on the Add Station or Edit Station pages.
• Volume controls do not appear.
Note: Port number 1 must always be used.

Adding a Station that Uses a Yeastar TA2400 Port
To add a station that uses a Yeastar TA2400 port to your Nyquist sys-
tem, follow the procedures for adding a station (See "Adding a Sta-
tion” on page 153). 
When you select Yeastar-TA2400 Analog FXS Port as the Device 
Type, you must select the Port Number that the station is attached 
to from the drop-down list. Valid values are 1 through 24. 
If you have only one phone attached to the TA2400, it must be 
attached to port 1. If you have multiple phones attached to the 
TA2400, one must be attached to port 1 but the use of the other 
ports can be random. For example, you can have phones attached to 
port 1, 2, 5, and 10. However, you cannot attach phones to just ports 
2, 5, and 10 since that combination does not include phone 1.
The following rules apply when adding a station to a Yeastar TA2400 
port:
• Device Type is Yeastar-TA2400 Analog FXS Port.
• You can select Admin Phone or IP Phone for Type.
• MAC Address is a required field. If you are adding the first station 
for this MAC Address, the Port Number is automatically set to 1.
• Paging is set to No and cannot be changed.
• Multicast Audio Distribution is set to No but does not appear 
on the Add Station or Edit Station pages.
• Volume controls do not appear.
Note: Port number 1 must always be used.
161
• Codecs Allowed is set to g722 and cannot be changed.
• If you enter 1 for Port Number, the Admin Web UI displays the 
VLAN settings, Web Username, and Web Password fields.
• Stations attached to the Yeastar TA2400 are not available for ring-
ing during Night Ring operations.
• You can associate an external (classroom) speaker to a TA2400 
port by selecting a Speaker Extension.
• After adding a station, the Yeastar TA2400 must be manually 
rebooted via the Yeastar TA2400’s web interface.
• The Nyquist Appliances Network Time Server Source will be 
used to configure the Network Time Service on the Yeastar 
TA2400. (See "Using the Yeastar TA2400” on page 158.)
• The Yeastar TA2400 time zone will be set to match the Nyquist 
server’s time zone.
3.4.3.3
Viewing Yeastar TA2400 Status
You can use the Station Status feature to view overall status of the 
Yeastar TA2400 device. (See "Viewing Station Status” on page 164.)

Viewing Queues
Warning
Changes to queues – including adding a queue, modi-
fying an existing queue, or deleting a queue – will
result in the deletion of all recorded pages that have
not yet played. Changes should only be done after
business hours or during a small maintenance window
that does not exceed 5 minutes.
With the Page Queuing feature, you can record an unlimited number 
of pages or messages for queuing (stacking) for a specified zone or 
zones. A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may 
have multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before 
a queue can be created.
Page Queuing is designed to eliminate feedback that can occur if a 
page is made in an area where a microphone and speaker are in close 
proximity. With page queuing, the page does not start until you (or 
the user recording the page) has indicated that the recording is com-
pleted.
Page Queuing also prevents page overlapping since pages sent to a 
queue play one at a time.
The Page Queuing feature differs from the Schedule Announcement 
(see "Using the Schedule Announcement Feature” on page 239) and 
Record Announcement (see "Monitoring/Recording” on page 479) 
features. The Schedule Announcement feature allows you to specify a 
date and time when the announcement is to be played, and the 
DTMF Code *990 allows a user to use the admin phone to record an 
announcement that is played immediately after it is recorded. 
Using the DTMF Codes *991 or *991*{Zone Number} or selecting 
Record Page from the Admin Phone or the Admin web UI allows you 
to initiate a queued page. 
When the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a zone 
page, Nyquist will start a queued page if the zone belongs to a 
queue. If you want to start a real-time page to the zone instead, dial 
#{Zone Number}*.
With the Page Queuing feature, the recorded page is placed in a 
zone’s queue. The pages in the zone’s queue are played in the order 
that they are placed in the queue.
A live page started on a zone that is playing a recorded page will 
cause the recorded page to be terminated and sent back to the 
queue. The interrupted message will play again, from the beginning

The Page Queuing feature differs from the Schedule Announcement 
(see "Using the Schedule Announcement Feature” on page 239) and 
Record Announcement (see "Monitoring/Recording” on page 479) 
features. The Schedule Announcement feature allows you to specify a 
date and time when the announcement is to be played, and the 
DTMF Code *990 allows a user to use the admin phone to record an 
announcement that is played immediately after it is recorded. 
Using the DTMF Codes *991 or *991*{Zone Number} or selecting 
Record Page from the Admin Phone or the Admin web UI allows you 
to initiate a queued page. 
When the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a zone 
page, Nyquist will start a queued page if the zone belongs to a 
queue. If you want to start a real-time page to the zone instead, dial 
#{Zone Number}*.
With the Page Queuing feature, the recorded page is placed in a 
zone’s queue. The pages in the zone’s queue are played in the order 
that they are placed in the queue.
A live page started on a zone that is playing a recorded page will 
cause the recorded page to be terminated and sent back to the 
queue. The interrupted message will play again, from the beginning 
175
of the message, when the zone becomes idle. Multi-Site Emergency-
All-Call, Multi-Site All-Call, Emergency All-Call, All-Call, Alarm, Tone, 
and Emergency Announcement will also interrupt any playing 
recorded zone messages. All re-queued interrupted messages will 
play again, from the beginning of the message, when the zones 
becomes idle.
Selecting Disable Audio will cause all recorded messages to stop. 
The messages will resume play from the beginning when audio is re-
enabled. 
For information about recording pages, see "Record Page” on 
page 334.

Adding a Queue
You can create multiple queues for stacking pages, and a queue may 
have one or more zones. However, a zone can only be associated 
with a single queue.
Warning
Changes to queues – including adding a queue, modi-
fying an existing queue, or deleting a queue – will
result in the deletion of all recorded pages that have
not yet played. Changes should only be done after
business hours or during a small maintenance window
that does not exceed 5 minutes.
Delay Between 
Messages
Number of seconds to pause between pages. 
The delay can range between 1 and 10 sec-
onds. The default is 2 seconds. 
Message Plays
How many times each page in the queue will 
play. The number can range between 1 and 
3. The default is 1, which means that the 
message plays only one time.
Zones
Select Show when viewing a queue to see 
the list of zones assigned to the queue. 
When adding a queue, only zones not 
already assigned to a queue and that are 
Paging, Paging+Time, Paging+Audio, and 
Paging+Time+Audio type appear in the 
drop-down menu.
Note: A zone can only be associated to a sin-
gle queue.

Managing Bridge Devices
Bridge Devices, such as the NQ-E7030 Analog Station Bridge (ASB), 
allow the E7000 solution to use the existing analog call switches, 25 
volt speakers, analog phones, and existing infrastructure when 
upgrading from Multicom 2000, Quantum Multicom IP, and sup-
ported third-party intercom systems. When used exclusively as a net-
worked component of the E7000 series paging and intercom 
solution, the ASB permits a hybrid IP/analog system configuration 
through use or connection of analog 25V speakers and associated 
analog call switches (for example, CA-15C type). 
The ASB has 24 station connections that attach to hardwired 25 volt 
speakers and their associated call switches. While each connection 
has its own SIP addressable Station ID, the ASB itself uses a single 
network IP address.

Using Admin Groups
You can place Admin Stations into Admin Groups, which are used if 
incoming calls are not answered by the assigned Admin Station or 
the Day or Night Admin associated with the Admin Station. Admin 
Groups act as an always answer feature by providing an alternate list 
of Admin Stations. If an incoming call is not answered by the assigned 
Admin Station within 30 seconds for normal calls or 15 seconds for 
emergency calls, all Admin Stations in the Admin Group will ring.
If Call Forwarding is enabled at the Admin Station, Nyquist tries the 
forwarded extension. If that station does not answer or is busy, the 
call timeout is reduced to 15 seconds. After 15 seconds, the call rolls 
over to the Admin Group.
In addition, if an emergency level call receives no answer, the Admin 
Group will ring if the Day Admin or Night Admin does not answer. 
You can assign Admin Stations to multiple Admin Groups. A Day or 
Night Admin can also be assigned to one or more Admin Groups.

Managing Audio
With Nyquist’s audio file management feature, you can:
• Specify an audio program for distribution to stations or zones.
• Record and play tones and announcements to stations or zones.
• Manage recordings of telephone calls made to and from stations.
Audio programs for distribution to stations or zones can include line-
input from the MMPA, Nyquist 2-channel or 4-channel amplifiers, 
user supplied songs or playlists, and Internet Radio Services. The 
Audio Distribution, tones, and announcement files added through 
the audio file management feature can be set through the Schedules 
feature to automatically play during specified times. (See "Managing 
Schedules” on page 217.) Through the Internet Radio Services, you 
can listen to live radio stations and add media catalogs and music 
services without updating devices or software. 
Default tone and song files include white noise and pink noise that 
allows you to tune paging and audio distribution volumes. 
Note: Before using the audio file management feature, make sure 
that stations and zones have been configured (see "Managing Sta-
tions, Zones, and Queues” on page 105) and that the station you are 
using to launch announcements, tones, or Audio Distribution has 
the appropriate CoS parameters set (see "Using CoS Configuration” 
on page 63).

Audio Distribution
Suppose you want to use an audio source, such as a radio station 
accessed via the Internet, in a cafeteria but prevent that source from 
being played in a conference room. This feature, called Audio Distri-
bution, can be turned on by zone (an area or group of stations) or 
stations (group of devices such as VoIP speakers). You can add the 
speakers, or stations, in the cafeteria to a zone that allows Audio Dis-
tribution while the speakers in a conference room would not be 
placed into that zone.
Audio Distribution involves creating a playlist or selecting an input 
source and specifying which zones hear the playlist or input source. 
Through the Scheduled Audio feature, Audio Distribution can be tied 
to a specific event in a schedule (see "Adding an Event” on page 227).

Playing Songs Directly from a USB Memory 
Stick
You can use a USB memory stick as storage for songs that can be 
played via the playlists feature.
To add songs and create a playlist for a USB memory stick, you must 
create a root file on the USB memory stick called MusicLibrary.txt. 
This file can contain the following entries:
• playlistname=<text entered by customer>
• createplaylist=no
• useexistingplaylist=yes
If createplaylist=no is found in MusicLibrary.txt, a playlist is not cre-
ated for the imported files.
If useexistingplaylist=yes is used, new songs will be added to the 
playlist defined by the playlistname option.
Music files must be on the root directory of the USB memory stick. 
Valid formats for these files are mp3, wav, and aac.
The Nyquist server automatically mounts the USB memory stick, adds 
all songs found in the root directory to the songs list, and creates a

Playing Songs Directly from a USB Memory 
Stick
You can use a USB memory stick as storage for songs that can be 
played via the playlists feature.
To add songs and create a playlist for a USB memory stick, you must 
create a root file on the USB memory stick called MusicLibrary.txt. 
This file can contain the following entries:
• playlistname=<text entered by customer>
• createplaylist=no
• useexistingplaylist=yes
If createplaylist=no is found in MusicLibrary.txt, a playlist is not cre-
ated for the imported files.
If useexistingplaylist=yes is used, new songs will be added to the 
playlist defined by the playlistname option.
Music files must be on the root directory of the USB memory stick. 
Valid formats for these files are mp3, wav, and aac.
The Nyquist server automatically mounts the USB memory stick, adds 
all songs found in the root directory to the songs list, and creates a

Announcements, Zones, and Priorities
You can select a zone for an announcement to play or select to play 
an announcement to all speakers. The Nyquist system also supports 
the simultaneous playing of multiple announcements to different 
zones. 
However, there are some set rules and priorities that govern how and 
when announcements play. For example, announcements played via 
an I/O controller can be played to a selected zone but not to All 
Speakers.
When you attempt to play a non-emergency, or Normal, announce-
ment to a zone, you will receive a busy signal if any of the following 
are true:
• An announcement, page, or recorded page is being played on the 
zone.
• An announcement is being played to All Speakers.
• An Alarm, Tone, All-Call, or Emergency All-Call is being played.
A Normal announcement plays to All Speakers only if all zones are 
idle and no higher level audio is playing. You will receive a busy signal 
if any of the following are true:
• A Normal or Emergency announcement is already playing to All 
Speakers.
• An announcement is already playing to a zone.
• A page or queued page is already playing to a zone.
• An Emergency-All-Call, All-Call, Alarm, or Tone is already playing.
If you attempt to play an emergency announcement to a zone or to 
All Speakers, you will receive a busy signal if any of the following are 
true:
• An emergency announcement is already playing to the zone or to 
All Speakers.
• An Emergency All-Call is already playing.
If you attempt to play an emergency announcement to a zone or to 
All Speakers that is already playing a non-emergency announce-
ment, an alarm or tone, a page or queued page, or an All-Call, the 
emergency announcement takes priority. A currently playing non-
emergency announcement, alarm or tone, page or queued page, or 
All-Call will stop playing.

Tuning Volume with White or Pink Noise
Nyquist provides white noise and pink noise files to help tune, or 
adjust, the volume of speakers in a zone.
White noise has equal energy for each frequency that the human ear 
can hear. Pink noise sounds less harsh than white noise because 
humans hear in octaves (the doubling of a frequency band). The 
energy in pink noise decreases by half as the frequency doubles, 
making the noise sound more balanced.
Both white and pink noise files are provided by default in Nyquist as 
both tones and songs. You can use the tone files as a tone generator 
to help adjust volume and frequency for pages in time-based zones. 
You can use the song files to help adjust volume and frequency in 
audio zones that play audio distribution.
Remember that when creating, editing, or viewing a zone, the Type 
identifies the zone as being able to receive paging, time, audio, or a 
combination of paging, time, or audio. (See "Viewing Zone Informa-
tion” on page 168.)
To launch a white noise or pink noise file as a tone, follow the steps 
listed in "Managing Tones Via the Dashboard” on page 346, selecting 
either the White Noise or Pink Noise file.
To play a white noise or pink noise file to a zone that plays audio dis-
tribution, first create a playlist that contains the white or pink noise 
song (see "Creating a Playlist” on page 259) and then follow the steps 
listed in "Using Audio Distribution” on page 353 to launch the audio 
distribution. 
If the zone can receive a combination of paging, time, and audio, you 
should use both the tone files and the song files to tune the speaker 
volume.

listed in "Managing Tones Via the Dashboard” on page 346, selecting 
either the White Noise or Pink Noise file.
To play a white noise or pink noise file to a zone that plays audio dis-
tribution, first create a playlist that contains the white or pink noise 
song (see "Creating a Playlist” on page 259) and then follow the steps 
listed in "Using Audio Distribution” on page 353 to launch the audio 
distribution. 
If the zone can receive a combination of paging, time, and audio, you 
should use both the tone files and the song files to tune the speaker 
volume.

facility and make the necessary changes. (See "Editing a 
Facility” on page 102.)
In addition to performing the troubleshooting steps through the 
Nyquist Admin Web UI, do the following:
• Check for network issues (Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area 
Network (WAN), VLAN, ports) that are preventing facility servers 
from communicating with each other.
• Ensure that you can access and operate the remote Nyquist facility 
server by logging on to the Admin Web UI for that server and

input source. Through the Scheduled Audio feature, audio distribu-
tion can be tied to a specific event in a schedule. For information 
about the Scheduled Audio feature, "Understanding Event Settings” 
on page 228.
Note: Before using the Audio Distribution feature, make sure that 
stations and zones have been configured and that the station you 
are using to launch Audio Distribution has the appropriate Class of 
Service (CoS) parameters set.
Note: If an audio distribution playlist that has a station assigned to 
it is playing, you cannot play another audio distribution playlist 
with a station assigned.

Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.
Step 2
Select the Add icon.
Step 3
Use the Line-Input/Playlist/Source drop-down menu 
to select the audio source.
Step 4
Select the Zones and Stations.
Step 5
If you select Line-Input as the Input Source/Playlist, 
select the Amplifiers/Matrix Mixers and Input Chan-
nel.
Step 6
If you select a playlist and want to shuffle the song 
order, set Shuffle to Yes.
Step 7
Select Save.
Step 8
To end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next 
to the playlist.
Figure 11-18, Create an Audio Distribution
Note: If you are using at least one Nyquist Matrix Mixer Pre-Amp, 
Line-Input appears as a Input Source/Playlist option.
355
To launch a previously created audio distribution:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.
Step 2
Select the Play icon next to the audio distribution that 
you want to launch.
Step 3
To end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next 
to the playlist.
An existing Audio Distribution can be edited or deleted, 
provided it is not currently playing or linked to a rou-
tine, by selecting the Edit or Delete icon next to the 
Audio Distribution.
When Audio Distribution is enabled, an informational message 
appears in the Messages window of the Admin Web UI dashboard, 
indicating the song that is currently playing and to which speakers 
(all or selected) and to which zones audio is playing to.
Audio distribution will be paused automatically by higher priority fea-
ture activation (for example, All-Call Page, Paging, Tones) and will 
automatically resume when the higher priority feature is finished.
When another system feature pauses Audio Distribution, the mes-
sage on the dashboard messages window includes PAUSED to 
remind you that Audio Distribution is still enabled but is currently 
paused.
Audio Distribution may also be started or stopped using Admin 
Phones. (Audio Distribution is available on the Admin Phone by 
selecting Directory and then selecting Features.)
If you select Set after making selections in the Audio Distribution 
panel of the dashboard, the displayed settings are updated on the 
server to allow Admin IP Phones to start Audio Distribution using the 
displayed settings. Selecting Set only updates the settings; it does 
not start the audio distribution.
Audio Distribution volume can be changed by setting Audio Distri-
bution Volume, available in System Parameters. 
All Nyquist stations are pre-programmed to receive Audio Distribu-
tion to All Stations. To disable Audio Distribution to a specific station, 
change Multicast Audio Distribution to No on the Edit Station 
page.
When Audio Distribution is started via the Admin Phone, any Admin 
web UI or Admin phone user may stop the Audio Distribution if his or 
356
her station has the Audio Distribution CoS Configuration parameter 
enabled.
Scheduled Audio has a higher priority than Audio Distribution. If you 
are playing Audio Distribution and an event with Scheduled Audio 
interrupts, the Audio Distribution briefly plays between the tone and 
the Scheduled Audio. 
A playlist will continue playing until manually stopped.
If you use a USB memory stick as storage for songs on a playlist and 
the USB memory stick is removed from the USB drive, the metadata 
for the songs and the playlist still resides in the Nyquist song list and 
playlist, but audio distribution cannot play.
11.9
Enabling and Disabling Audio
If a station’s CoS has been set up to enable and disable audio, then 
Enable Audio and Disable Audio icons appear in the lower section 
of the dashboard. These icons allow a station to control audio for the 
system during events such as fire alarms. Selecting Disable Audio 
stops all audio output on the system– such as Scheduled Audio, 
audio distribution, and paging – and prevents future audio output 
until Enable Audio is selected. If you select Disable Audio, you must 
select Continue when prompted to stop audio.

Manually Controlling Output Contacts
If you are using the Nyquist I/O Controller to recognize third-party 
contact closures, you can manually control output contacts. 
Prerequisites for using manual controls are adding an I/O Controller 
as a station and configuring a controller rule for at least one output 
contact with the Action set as Manual. (See "Configuring I/O Control-
ler Output Rules” on page 130.)

12Using the Maps Feature
359
Using the Maps Feature
With the Maps feature, you can select rooms, buildings, or other 
defined areas, such as bus loading zones or sports fields, from a 
graphic image to launch intercom calls or pages. You can use the 
Maps view to display Check-In status, listen to classrooms, and if the 
classroom has a camera, view video of the classroom. You can also 
create buttons to open a URL or execute a previously created routine.
To use the Maps feature, you must have the appropriate permissions 
(see "Assigning Maps Panel Permissions” on page 361).
When setting maps up in a Nyquist system environment, you can 
import JPEG or PNG graphics of your facility, buildings, rooms, or 
objects, such as icons or landmarks. You can then set up various 
defined action objects. Action objects are interactive shapes on the 
map that allow the launching of intercom calls or zone pages.
Nyquist also supports multiple maps for multi-site campuses. Each 
site can define its own map objects and restrict calls and paging to its 
own administrator. 
Maps can have an unlimited number of levels, so, for example, an 
office administrator could navigate to a building, a specific floor in 
the building, and a specific room on the selected floor. For locations 
that are frequently called or paged, a defined action object can be 
placed as a button on a top level or sub level view so that navigating 
through multiple levels of maps is not required to initiate a call or 
page.

serves as a button. For example, suppose you have layers of maps 
that include the buildings and each floor in a building, but you most 
frequently call one or two extensions. Rather than drilling down mul-
tiple maps or objects each time you call an extension, you can create 
a defined action object that is associated with that extension. The 
selectable object can be named for the extension and placed on the 
first level graphic. 
Another reason for creating a defined action object that serves as a 
button would be if your Nyquist system server is managing multiple 
sites on a single campus. All Call and Emergency All Call pages would 
go to all stations on the Nyquist system. If you want to make a page

ence a specific application, such as a video feed from a classroom. 
The full name, or path of the URL, must be entered in the URL field 
(see Table 12-2, “Edit Parameters,” on page 369). For example, to 
access the main Bogen web site, you would enter http://
www.bogen.com/.

13Using Routines
381
Using Routines
A routine automatically launches a procedure, or sequence of 
actions, that the Nyquist system executes as a result of an input trig-
ger. Routines can support your crisis plans for situations such as 
school lockdown, weather events, or emergency evacuation.
A routine can be started manually via the Admin Phone or the Admin 
Web UI. 
A routine can also be automatically launched:
• By an event, such as playing a specific announcement
• Via third-party switch contact closures recognized by the Nyquist 
I/O Controller
• Via a Routines API that can be used by third-party systems, 
including fire systems, access control systems, and video security 
systems 
A routine that has Allow DTMF enabled does not need a trigger. 
However, most routines will have at least one associated trigger and 
one or more actions. For example, if an administrator manually trig-
gers a lockdown routine, several actions could result, such as:
• Play a lockdown announcement.
• Display lockdown instructions on monitors connected to NQ-
GA10PV devices.
• Close I/O controller output contacts to trigger third-party systems 
that lock doors.
• Initiate the check-in process.
Note: You should always run a test of a routine after creating or 
editing it.

actions, that the Nyquist system executes as a result of an input trig-
ger. Routines can support your crisis plans for situations such as 
school lockdown, weather events, or emergency evacuation.
A routine can be started manually via the Admin Phone or the Admin 
Web UI. 
A routine can also be automatically launched:
• By an event, such as playing a specific announcement
• Via third-party switch contact closures recognized by the Nyquist 
I/O Controller
• Via a Routines API that can be used by third-party systems, 
including fire systems, access control systems, and video security 
systems 
A routine that has Allow DTMF enabled does not need a trigger. 
However, most routines will have at least one associated trigger and 
one or more actions. For example, if an administrator manually trig-
gers a lockdown routine, several actions could result, such as:
• Play a lockdown announcement.
• Display lockdown instructions on monitors connected to NQ-
GA10PV devices.
• Close I/O controller output contacts to trigger third-party systems 
that lock doors.
• Initiate the check-in process.
Note: You should always run a test of a routine after creating or 
editing it.
382
• Launch an emergency all call announcement.
To use the Routines feature, you must have the appropriate permis-
sions (see "Assigning and Editing Permissions” on page 176) and the 
station being used to launch the routine must have the CoS parame-
ter Execute Routines enabled. (see "Using CoS Configuration” on 
page 61).
To allow a third-party system to launch a routine via the Routines API, 
you must enable Allow API for the routine.
You can import or export routines by selecting the appropriate 
button from the Routines view. When importing a routine, the rou-
tine file must have a .sql extension. See "Exporting a Routine” on 
page 433 or "Importing a Routine” on page 435 for more information. 
13.1
Launching and Stopping a Routine from the 
Admin Web UI
You can manually launch a routine that has Allow DTMF enabled 
and stop a running routine from the Admin Web UI.
In addition to the routine needing Allow DTMF enabled, the Admin 
Web UI must have Execute Routines CoS enabled (see "Using CoS 
Configuration” on page 61).
To launch a routine from the Admin Web UI:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.

Launching a Routine from the Admin Phone
You can manually launch a routine that has Allow DTMF enabled 
from an Admin Phone by doing one of the following:
• Dial *94<Routine-DTMF-Code>.
• Select the Routines menu from the Admin Phone and then select 
the routine that you want to launch. 
In addition to the routine needing Allow DTMF enabled, the Admin 
Phone must have Execute Routines CoS enabled (see "Using CoS 
Configuration” on page 61).
If you disconnect the call during a routine, the routine continues until 
finished. If the routine includes Pause actions, the call will not discon-
nect until all Pause actions have been executed. 
A routine launched from the Admin Phone may end with any of the 
following page commands, provided the Admin Phone has the 
appropriate CoS enabled:
• All-Call
• Emergency-All-Call
• Facility-Page
• Multi-Site-All-Call
• Multi-Site-Emergency-All-Call
• Zone-Page
Note: Stopping a routine does not reverse any actions that the

Using the Routines API
You can allow third-party systems, such as access control systems, to 
launch a routine, or you can remotely launch a routine using the Rou-
tines API. 
The routine must be created from an Admin Station that has the CoS 
parameter Execute Routines enabled (see "Using CoS Configuration” 
on page 61).
The routine must have the Allow API parameter enabled (see "Edit-
ing a Routine” on page 387).
To remotely launch a routine using the Routines API:
Step 1
On the browser’s address line, type:
http://<server_ip_address>/routine/api/<routine_dtm-
f_code>/<password>/<delay_flag>
where:
 <server_ip_address> is replaced by the Nyquist 
server’s IP address
<routine_dtmf_code> is replaced by the routine’s DTMF 
code
<password> is replaced by the password associated 
with the extension defined in the routine. 
<delay_flag> is replaced by either 1 or 0. A setting of 1 
returns the status to the remote station after the rou-
tine finishes while a setting of 0 returns the status 
immediately after the routine launches.
Note: The routine cannot end with a paging action or any call type 
action that requires a user to speak.

option may be appropriate when a routine is 
expected to be executed by a caller dialing a 
DTMF code or when a routine trigger is asso-
ciated with an event that involves a caller (for 
example, All-Call, Zone Page) who has suffi-
cient CoS permissions to execute the rou-
tine's actions.
If Extension is used, this field must not be

Creating and Executing Multi-Site Routines
You can create a routine to be launched on one or more remote sites, 
such as a lockdown routine to be launched at all sites in a district.
To create such a routine, you would select the Routine action Type 
(see "Actions” on page 402 and "Understanding Action Parameters” on 
page 406). You can select to execute the action on the local facility, a 
specific facility, or all facility. If you want to execute the routine or 
multiple, but not all, facilities, you must create a separate action for 
each facility (using Routine action Type).
When you select a specific facility, you can enter the DTMF code of 
the routine. A routine with that DTMF code must exist on that facility.
Routines that are triggered by another site will not execute calling or 
paging type actions. Also, the receiving facility must have Use Caller 
Extension disabled.
Note: There will be a one-second delay between execution of one 
Routine action and another Routine action. So, if you execute a 
multi-site routine for 10 sites, there will be 10-second delay 
between when the routine starts on the first facility and when it 
starts on the tenth facility. To eliminate this delay, you can select 
All Facilities and then ensure that a routine with the specified 
DTMF does not exist on the sites that you do not want to run the 
routine. If All Facilities is selected, the remote routines start at the 
same time.

Parameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action 
page, though, the parameter names and available selections change 
based on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field 
called Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the 
tones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see "Viewing Avail-
able Tones” on page 256). With this type of action, you can also set 
the Duration, which appears on the Actions page as Parameter 3. 
Parameters 2 and 4 are not used for this type of action, but you can 
set a Finish Delay, which establishes if the routine should wait until 
this action is completed before starting the next action.
Some actions have no parameters. For example, if you select All-Call 
for Type, no parameters are applicable.
The following table describes the action Type and any applicable 
parameters.

ensure that the action to play an announcement waits until the alarm 
ends. 
13.11.7.1 Check-Intercom, Intercom-Wait, Ring-Wait Action 
Types
If a routine’s trigger Type is Intercom-Call, the routine’s action Type 
could be Check-Intercom, Intercom-Wait, or Ring-Wait. Each of 
these action types depend on the status of the Callers – parameter 1 
for the trigger (see "Understanding Trigger Parameters” on page 395).
The Check-Intercom action Type checks to see if the trigger caller is 
on an active intercom call. If the trigger caller is on an active intercom 
call, the routine executes subsequent actions. If the trigger caller is 
not on an active intercom call, the routine terminates and remaining 
actions will not be executed. You may want a routine to execute a 
Check-Intercom action Type before executing Intercom-Wait to 
ensure that the trigger caller is on an active intercom call.
The Intercom-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller’s call to 
finish. After the call finishes, the routine executes subsequent actions. 
If the call finishes before Intercom-Wait action Type is executed, the 
routine executes subsequent actions without delay.
The Ring-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller’s ringing to 
finish. After the ringing stage of a call ends, the routine executes sub-
sequent actions. If the call is answered before the Ring-Wait action 
Type executes, the routine executes subsequent actions without 
delay.
A sample scenario using these three actions is a routine that is exe-
cuted by the Intercom-Call trigger Type. The routine contains actions 
to be performed to indicate a ringing call The routine waits for the 
ring to finish (Ring-Wait action Type). When the ring finishes, the rou-
tine executes additional actions and then checks to see if the call was 
answered (Check-Intercom action Type). If the call was not answered 
(no active intercom call), the routine terminates. Otherwise, it exe-
cutes additional actions before waiting for the call to finish (Inter-
com-Wait action Type), and then when the call is finished, the routine 
executes the remaining actions.

alarm ends before the announcement begins. Otherwise, the

13.11.7.1 Check-Intercom, Intercom-Wait, Ring-Wait Action 
Types
If a routine’s trigger Type is Intercom-Call, the routine’s action Type 
could be Check-Intercom, Intercom-Wait, or Ring-Wait. Each of 
these action types depend on the status of the Callers – parameter 1 
for the trigger (see "Understanding Trigger Parameters” on page 395).
The Check-Intercom action Type checks to see if the trigger caller is 
on an active intercom call. If the trigger caller is on an active intercom 
call, the routine executes subsequent actions. If the trigger caller is 
not on an active intercom call, the routine terminates and remaining 
actions will not be executed. You may want a routine to execute a 
Check-Intercom action Type before executing Intercom-Wait to 
ensure that the trigger caller is on an active intercom call.
The Intercom-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller’s call to 
finish. After the call finishes, the routine executes subsequent actions. 
If the call finishes before Intercom-Wait action Type is executed, the 
routine executes subsequent actions without delay.
The Ring-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller’s ringing to 
finish. After the ringing stage of a call ends, the routine executes sub-
sequent actions. If the call is answered before the Ring-Wait action 
Type executes, the routine executes subsequent actions without 
delay.

13.11.7.2 Check-In Action Type with Check In Set to Wait
When the routine includes a Check-In action Type and Check-In

the Check-In process is Finished or you select Stop, Finish, or Reset, 
the routine resumes executing actions that follow a finished Check-In 
process such as: announcing Check-In completed to Admin Station 
speakers or displaying Check-in completion messages on web inter-
face dashboards or GA10PV displays. 
Check-In action Type with Check-In set to Wait does not differenti-

13.11.7.3 Feature-Wait Action Type with 911
You may want to include the Feature-Wait action Type in a routine 
that is triggered by a 911 call to pause subsequent actions until the 
911 call ends. In this scenario, set Feature Wait (parameter 1 of the 
Feature-Wait action Type) to 911.
After the 911 call ends, the routine executes subsequent actions. The 
911 trigger Type can execute routines when any caller dials 911, so 
multiple routines (one for each active 911 call) could execute.
Note: The check and wait actions described in this section are 
always related to the caller that triggered the routine. The routine 
settings for Extension and Use Caller's Extension are not related 
to these wait actions; the check and wait actions will always be 
evaluated based on the trigger caller regardless of the routine's 
Extension or User Caller's Extension settings.
Note: If you want to execute routine Actions after all stations have 
checked in (Check-In status is Done), create a routine with trigger 
Type set to Check-In and Parameter 1 set to Done.

use Tone as the trigger Type.
If you do not need the routine to wait until the tone finishes, you can 
sill use Feature-Wait as the action Type and Tone as Feature Wait 
and set Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) to the desired 
amount of time to wait.
13.11.7.13 Feature-Wait Action Type with Zone
If you want all zone pages to complete before continuing with subse-
quent routine actions, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Fea-
ture Wait (parameter 1) set to Zone.
This action will not allow you to specify a zone. The Announcement 
trigger Type does allow you to specify a zone (see "Understanding 
Trigger Parameters” on page 395). However, if multiple routines trig-
gered by a zone page use Feature-Wait action Type with Feature 
Wait set to Zone and multiple zone pages start, then all routines 
triggered by the start of a zone page will pause until the multiple 
zone pages have completed.

Zones and Stations Parameters for Deleting 
Display Messages
If you set Parameter 1 of Display-Msg-Delete action Type to 
PARAM, the options used for Zones and Stations determine which 
messages, if any, a routine automatically deletes from the dashboard 
and NG-GA10PV video displays. For example, if you leave Zones 
blank and set Stations to All, then messages that have no zones 
defined but do have stations defined will be deleted.

The availability of specific variables is based on the trigger that 
started the routine (see Table 13-8, “Variables, Definitions, and Avail-
ability,” on page 427). 
When using variables, be sure to allow enough room for the message 
text, including the new text replaced by the variable. For dashboard 
messages, the maximum text that can be displayed is 255 characters 
per message. The character limit for the NQ-GA10PV display is 4096 
characters, but the actual limit will vary due to font style and size. You 
should test your message display to ensure it fits into the available 
space.

Managing Display Messages
The Display Message option allows you to create messages that will 
display on monitors connected to NQ-GA10PV devices in a selected 
zone, in multiple zones, or to specific devices. When creating the 
message, you can set several options, including when and how long 
the message is displayed and the appearance of the message. You 
can also remove messages from the message queue. 
The station’s Display Configuration option controls the overall 
appearance of the display (for example, what type of clock appears, 
whether an event or the date appears, and the background color of 
the screen). For information about setting the display configuration 
for an NQ-GA10PV, see "Configuring Intercom HDMI Module Display

Manage Check-In
Manage Check-In allows you to quickly obtain status of specific areas 
– such as classrooms, offices, or breakrooms – within a facility during 
a check-in event. Examples of check-in events include:
• Weather related shelter in place
• Safety related lockdown
• Fire evacuation (Teacher performs check-in to indicate room has 
been evacuated.)
• Room occupancy (Teacher checks room in with start of each class 
period.)
During a check-in event, users check in by initiating a Normal call to 
their assigned Admin Station, such as the front office, using either 
their Nyquist phone or a digital or analog call switch associated with 
their intercom speaker or station.
During Check-In, a Normal call initiated by a station to the Admin 
Station places a station in checked-in status. Additional Normal calls 
made following a check-in are processed as Normal calls to the 
Admin Station.
You can also elect to enable audio feedback that tells the staff 
member they have successfully checked in.
Calls made as part of the Manage Check-In process are not applied 
towards the system’s Current Call Count. Urgent and Emergency calls 
can still be placed by stations and are not included as part of Manage 
Check-In. 
As long as Privacy Mode is not enabled and a room’s device allows 
two-way transmission, you can select to use Spy Mode to listen to 
the room.

After a station has successfully checked in, additional Normal calls 
will go through as normal calls to the Admin station. Stations can still 
place Urgent or Emergency calls during the Check-in process, even if 
the station has not checked in. 
If audio prompt feedback is enabled and a station checks in, the 
caller hears a confirmation prompt. If audio feedback is disabled, sta-
tions checking in with digital call switches will still see a ringing status 
(flashing green) for about 2 seconds while checking in. Stations 
checking in with IP phones will notice a call lasting about 2 seconds 
before automatic hang up.
A VoIP Speaker Only station that does not have a call switch can still 
participate in the check-in process if an I/O controller Input contact is 
connected to a switch present in the room that contains the VoIP 
Speaker Only station. In this case, the I/O controller Input contact 
closure can trigger a Routine that performs a check-in.
In this scenario, the routine Trigger Type is set to Input-Contact-
Closed (see "Understanding Trigger Parameters” on page 395) and 
the routine Action Type is Check-In with Station set to the VoIP 
Speaker Only station extension (see "Understanding Action Parame-
ters” on page 406).
If a station with call switch is configured to only place Urgent or 
Emergency calls, the station cannot participate in the Check-in pro-
cess. This station should either be added to the Exclusion List (see 
"Managing Exclusion and Vacancy Lists” on page 454). Or if you wish 
to include the station in the Check-in process, the station’s CoS con-
figuration should be changed to allow Normal calls to be placed by 
the station (see "Editing CoS Parameters for a Station” on page 66). 
15.1.1.2 Check-In Done and Finish
After all stations included in the Check-In process have checked in, 
the Manage Check-In Status changes to Done. 
Since stations that were not expected to check in may do so, check-in 
is not completed until you select the Finish button.
Selecting the Finish button can trigger a routine if you have a routine 
that uses Check-In as the trigger Type and Finished as Check-In.

Creating and Using Multiple Check-In Routines
You can create check-in routines for multiple purposes and to ensure 
that the vacancy and exclusion lists are accurate. 
You should create separate routines for drills and each type of emer-
gency check-in. For example, a fire drill could use audio explaining 
that it was a drill and would not include an actual 911 call where a 
routine used for evacuating during an actual fire could include a 911 
call. In this scenario, the word “drill” should appear in the name.
If you want to create routines for accurate exclusion and vacancy lists, 
use descriptive names such as “Fire Drill Period 1.” Each routine 
should include a Check-In action Type that uses Vacancy-Add and a 
separate Check-In action Type that uses Vacancy-Delete.

Check-In Log and Call Detail Records
Manage Check-In writes data to a log file (see "Using System Log 
Files” on page 315) and creates a Call Detail Record (see "Viewing Call 
Detail Records” on page 319). You can export and print the check-in 
log file using the Export button (see "Exporting a Log File” on 
page 318). You can also copy the displayed log file information and 
paste it into another application.
Each logged event starts with a date and time stamp, followed by the 
station extension that created the event, and ending with optional 
event related information. For example:

Managing Alerts
You can use Alert Filters and routines to manage if and how specific 
Emergency Alert System (EAS) events appear on the video display 
connected to the NQ-GA10PV. Your Nyquist server reads these EAS 
events, which include non-weather-related alerts, from the NWS.
To display EAS events:
Step 1
Decide which alerts you want to monitor and enable 
filters for those alerts, such as severity, certainty, and 
urgency (see "Alert Filters Configuration” on page 462).
Step 2
Create a routine (see "Adding a Routine” on page 387).
Step 3
Create an action for the routine that uses Display-Msg 
for the action Type (see "Actions” on page 402).
Step 4
Ensure the Text for the action contains the variables for 
the alerts you want to display (see "Setting Variables for 
the Display Message” on page 466).

Setting Variables for the Display Message
You can use the following variables in the Text field of a Display-
Msg to have NWS alerts automatically appear on the video display 
connected to the NQ-GA10PV:
• $alerts
• $auto_resize
The $auto_resize variable must be immediately followed by a number 
in parentheses, for example, $auto_resize(20). In this example, 
Nyquist automatically resizes the display message by decreasing the 
font size if needed to better fit the message to the screen but will 
keep the font size to at least 20. 
The $alerts variable is also immediately followed by parameters in 
parentheses. The available parameters are:
• AUTO_FIND_COUNTY. Automatically discovers the county code 
associated with the Nyquist server’s public IP address. 
• AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer>. Automatically compresses the 
display message if the number of lines in the message exceeds the 
<Integer> value. For example, AUTO_COMPRESS_15 will cause 
messages that contain more than 15 lines to be compressed by 
removing end-of-line characters (lines will run together, separated 
by a space instead of end-of-line). The resulting message will per-
haps be more difficult to read than the original. Use this option if 
Note: The font size will automatically resize to 20 if the Alert mes-
sage has these following parameters:
• Priority is smaller than 6.
• Text length is longer than 1500 characters.
• The text has more than 500 capital letter characters.
The font size also automatically resizes to 20 if needed, even if the 
$auto_resize variable is not specified.
Note: This option is not recommended if the server’s physical 
location is in a different county from your facility, if your server 
resides in the cloud, or if you are tracking alerts for multiple facili-
ties and those facilities are not in the same county. Instead, find 
and use your county code.

Setting Variables for the Display Message
You can use the following variables in the Text field of a Display-
Msg to have NWS alerts automatically appear on the video display 
connected to the NQ-GA10PV:
• $alerts
• $auto_resize
The $auto_resize variable must be immediately followed by a number 
in parentheses, for example, $auto_resize(20). In this example, 
Nyquist automatically resizes the display message by decreasing the 
font size if needed to better fit the message to the screen but will 
keep the font size to at least 20. 
The $alerts variable is also immediately followed by parameters in 
parentheses. The available parameters are:
• AUTO_FIND_COUNTY. Automatically discovers the county code 
associated with the Nyquist server’s public IP address. 
• AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer>. Automatically compresses the 
display message if the number of lines in the message exceeds the 
<Integer> value. For example, AUTO_COMPRESS_15 will cause 
messages that contain more than 15 lines to be compressed by 
removing end-of-line characters (lines will run together, separated 
by a space instead of end-of-line). The resulting message will per-
haps be more difficult to read than the original. Use this option if 
Note: The font size will automatically resize to 20 if the Alert mes-
sage has these following parameters:
• Priority is smaller than 6.
• Text length is longer than 1500 characters.
• The text has more than 500 capital letter characters.
The font size also automatically resizes to 20 if needed, even if the 
$auto_resize variable is not specified.
Note: This option is not recommended if the server’s physical 
location is in a different county from your facility, if your server 
resides in the cloud, or if you are tracking alerts for multiple facili-
ties and those facilities are not in the same county. Instead, find 
and use your county code.

you want to ensure that messages will fit on the screen. You may 
need to experiment to determine a suitable value for <Integer>. 
You can combine this option with the $auto_resize variable.
• <County-Code>. Displays weather alerts for the specified county. 
For example, the county code for Orange County, Florida, is 
FLC095.  
• INCLUDE_CODES. Displays, the Severity, Certainty, Urgency and 
Response codes on the Alerts header for each alert displayed on 
the NQ-GA10PV display (see Figure 16-2, “Sample Alert With Ele-
ments Defined,” on page 464).
• INCLUDE_COUNTY. Displays the county code on the Alerts head-
ers. This is useful if you have several Alert related routines that use 
different county codes.
• INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS. Displays instructions that came with 
the weather alerts. If you want to display the exact instructions 
provided by the NWS, then add the INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS 
option. Instructions are usually obvious (like seek shelter, stay 
indoors, stay hydrated). However, instructions can be verbose and, 
while they can provide valuable information, verbose instructions 
could cause the messages to be too large to display properly.
Note: Font sizes are set in the Display Message options (see "Cre-
ating a Display Message” on page 438). For weather alerts, the fol-
lowing settings are recommended for the Liberation Sans font:
• 30 - When not using the AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer> option 
of the $alerts variable and not using the $auto_resize variable. A 
font size of 30 will ensure that the actual lines from the NWS 
will fit on each line displayed.
• 65 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_15 and $auto_resize(25) 
variable.
• 40 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_25 and $auto_resize(25) 
variable.
• 70 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_<Inter> and $auto_resize 
variable with display message priority of 6.
Note: County codes are available at: https://alerts-v2.weather.gov/
counties.
468
• REPEAT_<Integer>. Automatically repeats the alert processing 
and re-displays any resulting alerts every <Integer> seconds. Pre-
vious alerts are automatically removed from displays. This option 
provides a convenient way to check for and display alerts at a reg-
ular interval without having to create a routine loop and without 
having to worry about deleting previous or expired alerts. When 
this option is used, no subsequent actions will be executed in the 
Routine that executes the Display-Msg action. Since alert pro-
cessing requires Internet access processing, Bogen recommends a 
minimum <Integer> value of 60 seconds. Using less than 60 sec-
onds may significantly impact your network and Nyquist server 
processing utilization.
• UPDATE_CACHE. Nyquist caches the found county code so the 
system does not have to search more than one time. 
If your county code changes, you can include the option 
UPDATE_CACHE along with AUTO_FIND_COUNTY to have the 
system discover the county code and cache the new value. 
Note: You should delete the UPDATE_CACHE option after use; 
otherwise, the Nyquist system searches for the county code each 
time alerts are retrieved.
469
A sample alert string is:
$alerts(FLC095,INCLUDE_CODES,AUTO_COMPRESS_15,REPEAT_60) 
This string will display alerts for county code FLC095 (Orange County, 
Florida) every 60 seconds including the Severity, Certainty, Urgency, 
and Repose codes, while automatically compressing alerts that have 
more than 15 lines.
16.4
Demonstration Alerts
Several demonstration, or sample, Alerts are available for display. 
These samples represent typical alerts sent by the NWS for various 
alert types.
You can access these by replacing the <County-Code> with 
ALERT_DEMO<number> where <number> is replaced with a number 
between 1 and 20 (for example, ALERT_DEMO10). Bogen recom-
mends that you try each demonstration alert to get familiar with the 
alert format, the available $alerts options, and the font sizing.
