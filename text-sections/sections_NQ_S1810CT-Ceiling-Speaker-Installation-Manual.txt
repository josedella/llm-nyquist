NYQUIST VoIP Ceiling Speaker
NQ-S1810CT Installation
The layout of the speakers should be planned before installation 
begins. Layout starts in one corner of the room.  The first speaker should be positioned from each wall a distance approximately equal to the ceiling height of the room.
The next speaker in row 1 should be spaced a distance approximately equal to twice the height of the 
ceiling. Each additional speaker in the row should 
use this same spacing.
Row 2 starts at twice the ceiling height distance from 
row 1 and twice the ceiling height from the wall.  The 
other speakers in this row are also spaced at twice 
the ceiling height.
Row 3 is again spaced at twice the ceiling height from 
the previous row. The first speaker starting this row is 
positioned at one ceiling height distance from the wall 
(similar to row 1). 
Continue this pattern of alternating rows until the room 
is covered.  The spacing of the speakers can be adjusted so that the speakers are evenly spaced in a row and 
are aesthetically pleasing.
The RE84 is an optional back box 
for ceiling speakers. UL Listed for 
use where ceiling plenum is part of 
an air handling system, the RE84 
also includes attachment tabs allowing the enclosure to be supported from structures other than 
the actual ceiling grid.

Mounting 
Ring
The TB8 supports the weight of 
the speaker and recessed enclosure. This is also the item to which 
the speaker mounting screws attach. The TB8 is required for each 
speaker assembly installed.
The MR8 Mounting Ring is a cold-
rolled steel unit, which will mount 
any of the Bogen ceiling grilles, for 
installations where the RE84 is not 
used.

Speaker Installation

Figure 1
1.	 Remove the tile from ceiling and center the TB8 tile 
bridge on the back.  Use the tile bridge to trace out, 
and then cut an 8-1/2” square hole. 	
	
NOTE: It can be more efficient to stack multiple ceiling 
tiles and then cut the speaker opening in a number of 
them at one time.
2.	 If using the optional RE84 Recessed Enclosure, bend 
up the 4 horseshoe tabs (Figure 1) on the TB8.  
3.	 Position the TB8 over the hole in the tile and push down the locator 
tabs (Figure 2).  
4.	 Using the 4 supplied screws, attach the NQ-S1801CT to the TB8 using the 4 clips in the corners of the 
opening on the TB8 as nuts. To complete the Speaker Connection, see STEP 6: Figure 3.
NOTE: Only tighten the screws until the grille is snug against the tile. Over tightening will cause the screws to 
dimple the grille.
5.	 Place the entire assembled ceiling tile back into the ceiling grid.

Speaker Connection
6. Make the electrical connections using 
    Category 5 or higher Ethernet cable with an   
    RJ-45 connector. It is recommended to use 
    shielded Category 5 or higher Ethernet 
    cable (Figure 3).
The power is supplied by PoE using an 
802.3af compliant network switch or PoE 
injector.
