NYQUIST Input/Output Controller
NQ-E7010 Installation and Use
The NQ-E7010 Input/Output (I/O) Controller allows 
Nyquist to recognize third-party switch contact 
closures and to provide external circuits. Designed 
to run on a 10/100 Ethernet network, the NQ-E7010 
is IEEE 802.3af compliant and can be powered using 
Power-Over-Ethernet (PoE), or if that is not available, 
it can be powered via an optional
48VDC 15W power adapter. The NQ-E7010 also 
has a USB 2.0 host port, which is reserved for 
future use.
Installation
The NQ-E7010 can either be shelf or wall mounted.
1.	  Either place the I/O Controller appliance on a 
shelf, or use the supplied brackets to mount it 
on a wall. 
2.	  Wire the input terminal(s) to the dry contact connection(s) of the system/device(s) that you want 
to monitor with Nyquist. 
3.	  Wire the open-collector output terminal(s) to the relay driver(s) of the system/device(s) that you 
want to control via Nyquist.
4.	  Connect the device to the 
10/100 network using a 
CAT5 type cable. 
You can now configure this device using the Nyquist web user 
interface (UI) or the Nyquist I/O 
Controller web UI. Refer to the 
Nyquist System Administrator 
Manual or to the NQ-E7010 Input/Output Configuration Manual 
for more information.

Viewing and Understanding LEDs
Two light emitting diodes (LEDs) appear on the 
front of the I/O Controller. One is labeled POWER 
and appears as solid red during initial power up, 
flashes green during a boot sequence, and appears solid green when fully booted.
The STATUS LED uses the following indicators to 
provide information about the I/O Controller:
•	
Flashing red – No network connection found.
•	
Solid blue – The I/O Controller is in an uninitialized state and is not associated to a server. 
(The server may be in a discovery mode.)
•	
Solid green – The I/O Controller is registered to a Nyquist server and is in normal operation.
•	
Flashing green – The I/O Controller has an IP address but is not registered with the Nyquist 
server.
•	
Solid red – The I/O Controller needs to be rebooted or reset so that the Nyquist application 
can resume.
•	
Flashing Blue – The I/O Controller is updating.

Using the Reset Button
The Reset button allows you to restart the I/O Controller or to reset the appliance’s configuration settings to the factory default settings. For more information about resetting configuration settings, refer to the NQ-E7010 Input/
Output Controller Configuration Manual.
