Using the VoIP Phone
The Bogen Model NQ-T1000 VoIP Phone by Yealink is designed to 
serve as an admin or staff phone for various Nyquist systems. This 
phone combines a traditional telephone keypad with a 132 x 64 pixel, 
backlit graphical Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to provide rapid, effi-
cient, and reliable control over many Nyquist features, such as 
launching Emergency-All-Call pages and paging zones. 
This manual guides you through the use of the VoIP Phone with the 
Nyquist system.
1
Hardware Components and Features
The main components of the VoIP Phone are the LCD screen and the 
keypad. The LCD screen shows the time of date and the station num-
bers and call-in priority of stations that are calling in. Depending 
upon the system CoS programming, the VoIP Phone can display 
menus to activate Zone Paging, All-Call Paging, Emergency All-Call 
Paging, alarm signals, audio files, and external functions.
Note: Various T1000 menu controlled features are only available if 
the station Type is set to Admin Phone.

Configuring the VoIP Phone
Refer to the applicable Nyquist System Administrator Manual for 
instructions on adding the VoIP Phone as a station. You will need the 
Extension Number, Name, and MAC address for the phone.
Next, configure the VoIP Phone through the phone’s web user inter-
face (UI).
To configure the VoIP Phone:
Step 1
Identify the phone’s Internet Protocol (IP) address by 
doing one of the following:
•
Locate the IP address in your network’s Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client table.
•
Press the VoIP Phone’s OK navigation key to dis-
play the IP address.
Step 2
Open your computer’s web browser, enter the phone’s 
IP address (for example, http://192.168.0.10 or 
192.168.0.10) in the address bar, and then press Enter. 
The computer will display the VoIP Phone’s web UI. 
Step 3
On the logon page, enter the Username (default is 
admin) and Password (default is bogen) and click 
Confirm.

Step 5
Click Auto Provision.
Step 6
Select Off for PNP Active.
Step 7
Select Off for DHCP Active.
Step 8
Enter the Server IP address in the Server URL field.
Step 9
Click the Confirm button.
Step 10
Reboot the phone by unplugging the network connec-
tion.
The phone will reboot, automatically download its configuration 
information from the server, and reboot a second time to come 
online.

Making Pages
The VoIP Phone allows the following types of paging from the 
phone’s LCD screen:
• All-Call
• Emergency All-Call
• Station, Zone, or Faciity
You can place a page in one of three ways:
• Using the handset
• Using the speakerphone
• Using the headset
=====
8
3.1
All-Call Paging
An All-Call page is a non-emergency page that simultaneously plays 
throughout the facility.
To make an All-Call page:
Step 1
Select the soft key labeled Directory.
Step 2
Use the navigation keys to select Paging and then 
press OK.
Step 3
Use the navigation keys to select All-Call and then 
press OK.
Step 4
Talk into the handset, or if using the speakerphone or 
headset, talk into the microphone.
Step 5
Hang up when finished.
3.2
Emergency-All-Call Paging
An Emergency-All-Call page is a high priority page that simultane-
ously plays throughout the facility. An Emergency-All-Call page has a 
higher priority than an All-Call or Normal page.
To make an Emergency-All-Call page:
Step 1
Select the soft key labeled Directory.
Step 2
Use the navigation keys to select Paging and then 
press OK.
Step 3
Use the navigation keys to select All-Call-EMERGENCY 
and then press OK.
Step 4
Talk into the handset, or if using the speakerphone or 
headset, talk into the microphone.
Step 5
Hang up when finished.
3.3
Record Page
You can record a page to be added to a zone queue. The maximum 
length time for a recorded page is 60 minutes; if the recording
exceeds 60 minutes, it will time out and not be saved. If the recording 
is silent for 60 seconds, it will time out and not be saved.
Pages in a zone’s queue are played in the order that they are placed 
in the queue. A live page started on a zone that is playing a recorded 
page will cause the recorded page to be terminated and sent back to 
the queue. The interrupted message will play again from the begin-
ning of the message when the zone becomes idle. Multi-Site Emer-
gency-All-Call, Multi-Site All-Call, Emergency All-Call, All-Call, Alarm, 
Tone, and Emergency Announcement will also interrupt any queued 
messages playing in any zones. All re-queued messages will play 
again from the beginning of the message when the applicable zones 
become idle.
Selecting Disable Audio will cause playback paging of all recorded 
messages to stop. The messages will resume play from the beginning 
when audio is re-enabled.
To record a page for page queuing:
Step 1
Select the soft key labeled Directory.
Step 2
Use the navigation keys to select Paging and then 
press OK.
Step 3
Use the navigation keys to select Record Page and 
then press OK.
Step 4
When prompted, enter the queue number for the 
queue that you want to page and press #.
Step 5
Wait for the tone and then record your message.
Step 6
Hang up when finished.
Note: When the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a 
zone page, Nyquist will start recording a queued page if the zone 
belongs to a queue. If you want to start a real-time page to the 
zone instead, dial #{Zone Number}*.
=====

Zone Paging
You can choose to page only certain areas of the facility, called zones. 
The zones, which are collections of stations, must be created through 
the Web-based System Admin User Interface (UI) before zone paging 
from the VoIP Phone can occur. Zones appear in the phone’s Direc-
tory under the Paging menu. The Paging menu also includes entries 
for Facility Paging when applicable.
To make a zone page:
Step 1
Select the soft key labeled Directory.
Step 2
Use the navigation keys to select Paging and then 
press OK.
Step 3
Select Zone.
Step 4
Talk into the handset, or if using the speakerphone or 
headset, talk into the microphone.
Step 5
Hang up when finished.
4

Forwarding Calls
If your VoIP Phone has the appropriate CoS parameter set, you can 
forward your calls to another Nyquist extension, whether it’s a physi-
cal station or a Web UI station. You can select to always forward calls, 
forward calls if you are on another call, or forward calls if they are not 
answered within a specified number of seconds.
The DAHDI FXS based Admin Station (also known as Analog Phone 
station Type) does not display an incoming call queue, and there is 
no incoming call queue prioritization. If the DAHDI FXS based Admin 
Station is already on a call, subsequent VoIP call-switch callers will 
continue to ring as expected. However, there is no visibility that an 
incoming call is happening, and there is no FIFO queue to handle 
multiple incoming calls.
If a VoIP phone directly calls a DAHDI FXS Admin Station that is  busy, 
the call will go to voicemail.
For incoming emergency calls from an Analog Call Switch and 
Speaker or Digital Call Switch and Speaker station types, if the DAHDI

=====
FXS based Admin Station is on a call, the current call will automati-
cally be dropped and the Admin Station will hear a busy signal. When 
the Admin Station hangs up the call, the emergency call will ring the 
Admin Phone.
If both a normal and emergency call are placed to a DAHDI FXS 
based Admin Station at the same time, the calls are not received in 
any specific order. The normal call could be answered before the 
emergency call. In this case, when the Admin Station hangs up the 
normal call, the emergency call will ring the Admin Station.
If the Admin Station remains busy for more than two minutes, an 
Analog Call Switch and Speaker or Digital Call Switch and Speaker 
caller will be told that the call cannot be completed and to please try 
again. The call switch will return to the idle state.
