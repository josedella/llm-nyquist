4.	 If connecting auxiliary devices, such as a key­
board, mouse, or video monitor, connect the 
devices’ cables to the appropriate connectors on 
the back of the device.

the HDMI video output as the Digital Video Inter­
face (DVI) output is not supported.  Use of the 
RS232 ports is  also not supported.
5.	 Toggle the Power switch to the On position.
Once the System Controller is powered on and con­
nected to the network, it can be accessed and 
configured via the device’s web-based GUI.  There 
are two IP addresses available to access the web-
based GUI: 1) a default static IP (192.168.1.10) on 
Ethernet Port A and 2) Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP) on Ethernet Port B. 

NOTE:  You must have a valid software 
license activation key to set up and configure 
the System Controller during its initial use.
