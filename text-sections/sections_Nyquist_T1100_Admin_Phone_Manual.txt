Using the Admin Phone
The Bogen Model NQ-T1100 by Yealink is designed to serve as the 
Administrative Display Phone, or Admin Phone, for Nyquist E7000 
Series systems. This phone combines a traditional telephone keypad 
with a color touch screen to provide rapid, efficient, and reliable con-
trol over many Nyquist E7000 features, such as launching Emergency-
All-Call pages and managing school bell schedules. 
This manual guides you through the use of the Admin Phone with the 
Nyquist system.

3.6
Record Page
You can record a page to be added to a zone queue. The maximum 
length time for a recorded page is 60 minutes; if the recording 
exceeds 60 minutes, it will time out and not be saved. If the recording 
is silent for 60 seconds, it will time out and not be saved.
Pages in a zone’s queue are played in the order that they are placed 
in the queue. A live page started on a zone that is playing a recorded 
page will cause the recorded page to be terminated and sent back to 
the queue. The interrupted message will play again from the begin-
ning of the message when the zone becomes idle. Multi-Site Emer-
gency-All-Call, Multi-Site All-Call, Emergency All-Call, All-Call, Alarm, 
Tone, and Emergency Announcement will also interrupt any queued 
messages playing in any zones. All re-queued messages will play 
again from the beginning of the message when the applicable zones 
become idle.
Selecting Disable Audio will cause playback paging of all recorded 
messages to stop. The messages will resume play from the beginning 
when audio is re-enabled.
Note: When the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a 
zone page, Nyquist will start recording a queued page if the zone 
belongs to a queue. If you want to start a real-time page to the 
zone instead, dial #{Zone Number}*.

Changing the Event Schedule
Nyquist allows the setting of bells and announcements to be played 
at specific times and in specific zones. More than one schedule can 
be created for a school. For example, a school may have an early 
release day on Wednesday and have classes begin and end at differ-
ent times on that day than on the other days of the week. Based on 
this example, a Regular Schedule or an Early Release Schedule can be 
selected for the current day. 
The Schedules feature available via the Admin Phone provides a 
quick way to change the bell schedule for the day. For example, if you 
normally use an Early Release Schedule for Wednesdays but want to 
use this schedule for today (which is slated to use the Regular Sched-
ule), you can select the Early Release Schedule through the Admin 
Phone. 
To change today’s schedule:

forward your calls to another Nyquist extension, whether it’s a physi-
cal station or a Web UI station. You can select to always forward calls, 
forward calls if you are on another call, or forward calls if they are not 
answered within a specified number of seconds.
The DAHDI FXS based Admin Station (also known as Analog Phone 
station Type) does not display an incoming call queue, and there is 
no incoming call queue prioritization. If the DAHDI FXS based Admin 
Station is already on a call, subsequent VoIP call-switch callers will 
continue to ring as expected. However, there is no visibility that an 
incoming call is happening, and there is no FIFO queue to handle 
multiple incoming calls.
If a VoIP phone directly calls a DAHDI FXS Admin Station that is  busy, 
the call will go to voicemail.
For incoming emergency calls from an Analog Call Switch and 
Speaker or Digital Call Switch and Speaker station types, if the DAHDI
=====
15
FXS based Admin Station is on a call, the current call will automati-
cally be dropped and the Admin Station will hear a busy signal. When 
the Admin Station hangs up the call, the emergency call will ring the 
Admin Phone.
If both a normal and emergency call are placed to a DAHDI FXS 
based Admin Station at the same time, the calls are not received in 
any specific order. The normal call could be answered before the 
emergency call. In this case, when the Admin Station hangs up the 
normal call, the emergency call will ring the Admin Station.
If the Admin Station remains busy for more than two minutes, an 
Analog Call Switch and Speaker or Digital Call Switch and Speaker 
caller will be told that the call cannot be completed and to please try 
again. The call switch will return to the idle state.

17
Customizing Line Keys
Line keys are the soft keys that appear on the display window (see 
"Display Window Features” on page 4). Nyquist provides one key 
(located on the upper left) for user customizing, providing a “speed 
dialing” option for a feature. For example, you can customize the 
available line key to start a specific alarm. You can then select the line 
key to start the alarm rather than using the steps described in "Play-
ing Alarms” on page 13.
If you do not want to use the Nyquist defaults for line keys, you can 
reserve line keys by creating and editing a reserve line key file 
(.rlkeys), provided you are not using the Nyquist System Controller. 
Note: Only routines with Allow DTMF enabled appear in the 
menu.
Note: Depending on the CoS settings for your Admin Phone, some 
of the line keys may appear blank. For example, if your Admin 
Phone does not have Execute Routines enabled through the CoS, 
then the fourth key on the left, which by default is reserved by 
Nyquist for Routines, has a blank label.
=====
22
For information about this procedure, see "Reserving Line Keys by 
.rlkeys File Creation” on page 22.
To customize the line key:
Step 1
On the phone’s display window, long press the key that 
you want to customize.
Step 2
For the Type, select SpeedDial.
Step 3
For Account ID, select the line that you are customiz-
ing.
By default, Line 1 is associated with the Nyquist system 
and would be the appropriate choice.
Step 4
For Label, type a label that will appear on the display 
window for this key. The label should describe what 
occurs when you select the line key (for example, Fire 
Alarm).
Step 5
For Value, enter the DMTF code sequence that is to be 
dialed on the Nyquist system when the soft key is 
pressed. For example, to play a fire alarm, you would 
enter *91 and the number of the alarm that you want to 
play. For a list of DMTF codes, see "Nyquist DTMF Fea-
ture Dialing Codes” on page 25.
Step 6
Press Save.
To remove programming from the line key:
Step 1
On the phone’s display window, long press the key.
Step 2
For the Type, select N/A.
Step 3
Press Save.
17.1
Reserving Line Keys by .rlkeys File Creation
If you want to customize a line key reserved by Nyquist, you must 
create and configure a .rlkeys file.
Note: You cannot perform this process if you are using the Nyquist 
System Controller.
=====
23
To create and configure a .rlkeys file:
Step 1
Identify the MAC address of your Admin Phone.
Step 2
On the Nyquist server, use the Linux command line to 
create a file in /srv/tftp called <mac-address>.rlkeys 
where <mac-address> is replaced by the Admin 
Phone’s MAC address.
Step 3
In the file created, add comma separated entries for 
each line key using the format l<line-key-number>.
For example, to reserve line keys 3, 5, and 6, you would 
type l3,l5,l6.
Step 4
Save the file.
Step 5
At the Linux command prompt, type:
chgrp www-data /srv/tftp/<mac-address>.rlkeys
chmod 664 /srv/tftp/<mac-address>.rlkeys
Step 6
At the Admin Web UI, select Stations.
Step 7
Select the Edit icon next to the station listing for your 
Admin Phone.
Step 8
Select Save.
Note: The <mac-address>.rlkeys configuration files will be saved 
in system backups. You may want to perform a system backup after 
making changes to these files, so that your changes are preserved 
whenever you perform a system restore.
=====
24
You can now follow the steps in "Customizing Line Keys” on page 21, 
and the Nyquist server will not overwrite your changes.
The following line-keys can be reserved for your own custom use:
The l9 key also supports Record Announcement with DTMF Code 
*990 and Stop Announcement with DTMF Code *93.
