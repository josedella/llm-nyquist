The NQ-GA20P2 
Integrated 
Power 
Amplifier 
Installation 
and Use
The NQ-GA20P2 is a 20W plenum rated Class 
D integrated power amplifier. Designed to 
operate over a 10/100 Ethernet network, the 
NQ-GA20P2 is IEEE 802.3at compliant and can 
be powered using Power-Over-Ethernet Plus 
(PoE+) or the optional Bogen PS4830W 48VDC 
power adapter. The NQ-GA20P2 can direct drive 
a single 8 ohm load and has a balanced line out 
to drive auxiliary power amplifiers.

=====

The NQ-GA20P2 Servicing is required when 
the apparatus has been damaged in any 
way, such as power-supply cord or plug is 
damaged, liquid has been spilled or objects 
have fallen into the apparatus, the apparatus 
has been exposed to rain or moisture, does 
not operate normally, or has been dropped.
Installation
To install the NQ-GA20P2 amplifier:
1.	 Attach the desired analog speakers to the 
NQ-GA20P2 using the pluggable connectors 
provided, where the 1 and 2 terminals 
connect to the +/- speaker wires. (See Figure 
1.) The G (ground) shield terminal can be 
used if necessary.
2.	 If desired, attach an auxiliary amplifier to 
the NQ-GA20P2 using pins 1 and 2 of the 
pluggable balanced LINE OUT connector, 
taking note of the marked polarity (+/-). The 
G shield terminal can be used if necessary.
3.	 Connect a Cat5 type cable into the module’s 
Ethernet port and ensure the other end of the 
cable is correctly connected to a PoE+ switch 
port on your network.

4.	 If using a 48V power supply, connect the 
PS4830PV 48VDC power supply to the 
1200 MacArthur Blvd. Suite 304, 
Mahwah, NJ 07430

Viewing and 
Understanding 
LEDs of The NQ-GA20P2 
Two LEDs appear on the front of the amplifier 
chassis. One is labeled POWER and appears 
as solid red during initial power up, flashes green 
during a boot sequence, and appears solid green 
when fully booted.
The STATUS LED uses the following indicators to 
provide information about the module:
•	
Flashing red – No network connection found.
•	
Solid blue – The amplifer is in an uninitialized 
state and is not associated to a server. (The 
server may be in a discovery mode.)

•	
Solid green – The amplifer is registered to a 
Nyquist server and is in normal operation.
•	
Flashing green – The amplifer has an IP 
address but is not registered with the Nyquist 
server.
•	
Solid red – The amplifer needs to be rebooted or reset so that the Nyquist application 
can resume.
•	
Flashing Blue – The amplifer is updating.
Using the Reset Button
The Reset button allows you to 
restart the amplifer or to reset the 
amplifier’s configuration settings 
to the factory default settings. 
For more information about resetting 
configuration settings, refer to the Nyquist NQ-
GA20P Configuration Manual.
