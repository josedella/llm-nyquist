Site Survey Guide
This document provides prerequisites and initial setup instructions
for the E7000 system, an Internet Protocol (IP) network based inter-
com and paging solution that allows school personnel to:
• Control facility bell schedules, announcements, and tones.
• Create and manage paging, time, and audio zones. 
• Manage station types, configuration, and Class of Service (CoS). 
• Manage users, roles, and permissions.
E7000 can be implemented as a new system installation or as an 
upgrade to an existing Multicom 2000, Quantum, or third-party inter-
com and paging system.
E7000 application software can be installed on a customer-provided 
server that meets the minimum server requirements (see "E7000 
System Server Requirements” on page 3). If using a NQ-SYSCTRL 
System Controller, both the operating system and the E7000 applica-
tion software is already installed and only needs to be activated.
Before installing or activating E7000, ensure that:
• System server requirements are met (user-provided server only).
• Required services are installed and enabled on the E7000 system 
server. Examples of required services include Simple Network 
Management Protocol (SNMP) or Trivial File Transfer Protocol 
(TFTP). 
• Required services are enabled on your network. Examples of 
required services include multicast and Session Initiation Protocol 
(SIP).
• Required multicast IP addresses and ports are known and avail-
able.
• Required IP addresses are known and available.
• Required port numbers are open.

1.1
Understanding System Requirements
The E7000 web-based UI requires a secure Hypertext Transfer Proto-
col Secure (https) type network connection to the E7000 system
server. Users can log in to the E7000 system using the Google
Chrome web browser from a computer or tablet running either a
Windows 8.1 (or later) or a Mac OS X 10.12.x (or later) operating
system (OS). The UI can also be accessed via a Chrome browser
enabled Android-based tablet or mobile device. To access the server,
type your server’s IP address (for example, 10.10.20.12).
1.1.1
Whitelisted Web Addresses
E7000 requires access to specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
commonly referred to as web addresses. Access to many of these
web addresses is required during installation; access to other web
addresses, such as the address for the Network Time Server (NTS) are
required during runtime. The Information Technology (IT) depart-
ment for the site must whitelist the web addresses so that they can
be easily accessed as needed.
The following table lists the URLs that must be whitelisted.

Multicast IP Addresses
A minimum of three multicast IP Addresses are required for an E7000
system:
• Emergency-All-Call Multicast RTP IP Address
• All-Call Multicast RTP IP Address
• Audio Distribution Multicast IP Address
These multicast RTP IP Addresses are entered when setting System
Parameters. 
If you want to use multicasting for zones, a multicast IP Address is
needed for each multicast zone. 
A zone is a collection of stations. E7000 stations consist of any SIP-
enabled device (personal computer (PC), tablet, smart phone), VoIP
speaker or VoIP phone connected to the system and assigned an
extension. No limit exists for the number of zones or for the number
of stations that can be in a multicast zone. 
Multicast IP Addresses for zones are set through the Zones menu and
are added when creating a zone or when editing a zone.
1.1.6
Multicast Ports
Multicast ports must be set for each multicast IP address. When set-
ting Multicast ports for zones, the port number must start with an
even number and a range of four is needed between port numbers.
For example, if Zone 1 uses Multicast Port Number 6010, then Zone 2
cannot use port 6011, 6012, or 6013.
1.1.7
IP Addresses
IP addresses (static or dynamic) are needed for each of the following
items:
• E7000 System Controller or server
• Each E7000 VoIP phone
• Each E7000 appliance
• Each device used to access the Web UI (PC, Mac, tablet, or mobile)

Devices
Cat5 or better cabling
ASB Speaker and 
Call Switch Con-
nections
West Penn 357 cable or equivalent
Note: While the system is entirely CAT5 or 
better cable compatible, it is not advisable to 
use category wiring for two-way intercom 
stations in installations where Electromag-
netic Field (EMF) interference is a possible 
concern. In such environments, it is recom-
mended to use West Penn #357, Belden 
#8724, or equivalent cabling to protect 
against cross talk and noise induced by EMF 
interference.
Digital Call 
Switches
Cat5 or equivalent cabling (The CAN 2.0 BUS 
connection on these devices allows them to 
be daisy-chained.)
I/O Controller
Cat5 or any other 2-wirer (or denser) cable 
with a 500mA or better current rating.
Matrix Mixer Pre 
Amp
Audio connections by input type (for exam-
ple, XLR, pluggable screw terminal connec-
tors); use 2-conductor or 3-conductor 
shielded cable (as needed for balanced or 
unbalanced) to reduce electromagnetic inter-
ference (EMI) or radio frequency (RF) interfer-
ence to the Line or MIC inputs.
=====
11
VoIP Intercom 
Module
Cat5 or equivalent cabling for the CAN Bus 
Port
2-conductor or 3-conductor shielded cable 
(as needed for balanced or unbalanced) to 
reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) or 
radio frequency (RF) interference on the Line 
Level outputs for Ambient Mic Input, Push-
to-Talk Mic Connection, and Relay Contact
HDMI 1.3 cable or better for HDMI output
West Penn 357 cable or equivalent for call 
switch input and analog speaker connection
Note: While the system is entirely CAT5 or 
better cable compatible, it is not advisable to 
use category wiring for two-way intercom 
stations in installations where Electromag-
netic Field (EMF) interference is a possible 
concern. In such environments, it is recom-
mended to use West Penn #357, Belden 
#8724, or equivalent cabling to protect 
against cross talk and noise induced by EMF 
interference.

1.1.10
Telephony Environment
The Nyquist E7000 can interface with a customer’s telephony system
in the following ways:
• Network-based SIP trunks to PSTN or Cloud-based VoIP provider
• Network-based SIP Tie-Lines to the premises-based IP-PBX
• FXS ATA to the premises-based PBX or IP-PBX
Use of FXS ATA requires purchase/use of a third-party FXS VoIP Gate-
way device (for example, Cisco SPA112 Two Port Phone Adapter)
Using SIP trunks allows full bi-directional calling between any E7000
station and the IP-PBX/PBX/PSTN and supports features such as E-
911 calling, remote call transfer, and off-premise calling. The FXS ATA
option only allows a station on the PBX to dial through” to the
Nyquist system where it will receives a second dial tone to initiate
DTMF controlled paging, intercom calls, etc.
Set up an appointment with both Bogen Technical Support (800-995-
2809) and the PBX vendor or customer (if the customer maintains the
telephony system) to assist during integration of the E7000 and tele-
phony systems.

designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to com-
municate with each other in applications without a host 
computer; a message-based protocol, it was designed 
originally for multiplex electrical wiring within automo-
biles.
Domain Name System 
(DNS)
One of the protocols that comprise the TCP/IP suite, it 
converts Internet domain and host names, like those in 
URLs from a web browser, into IP addresses.

Dynamic Host Config-
uration Protocol 
(DHCP)
A standardized network protocol that is used on Internet 
Protocol (IP) networks and is controlled by a DHCP 
server that dynamically distributes network configura-
tion parameters, such as IP addresses, for interfaces and 
services
Emergency-All-Call
A top priority all-call page to all stations, even those that 
have been set up for page exclusion
