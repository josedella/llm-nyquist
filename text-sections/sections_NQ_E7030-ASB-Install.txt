NQ-E7030 
Analog 
Station 
Bridge
Installation and Use
The Nyquist Analog Station Bridge (ASB) allows the 
E7000 solution to use the existing call switch and 
speaker infrastructure when upgrading from Multicom 2000, Quantum IP, and third-party intercom 
systems. When used as a networked component 
of the Nyquist E7000 series paging and intercom 
solution, the NQ-E7030 permits a “hybrid” system 
configuration through use of 25V/70V speakers and 
associated call switches (for example, Bogen CA15C 
type). The ASB has 24 station connections that attach to speakers and their associated call switches. 
While each connection has its own Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) addressable Station ID, the ASB itself 
uses a single network IP address.
WARNING: To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, 
do not expose this apparatus to rain or moisture.
Avertissement: pour réduire le risque d’incendie ou de 
choc électrique, ne pas exposer cet appareil sous la 
pluie et l’humidité.

Field Wiring
Use generally accepted engineering best practices 
as established by the EIA and the NEC for system 
wiring and equipment installation. Test all wiring 
to ensure it is free from grounds and shorts. Label 
system wiring at both ends using room numbers as 
indicated in the architectural graphics package. For 
system wiring, follow manufacturer’s recommendations for device type. All terminal connections must 
be on barrier strips.
While the system is entirely CAT5 or better cable 
compatible, it is not advisable to use category wiring 
for two-way intercom stations in installations where 
Electromagnetic Field (EMF) interference is a possible concern. In such environments, it is recommended to use West Penn #357, Belden #8724, or equivalent cabling to protect against cross talk and noise 
induced by EMF interference.
Use CAT5 or better network cabling for all IP-based 
system devices such as network equipment, system appliances, and VoIP phones. Cable lengths for 
Ethernet connections should not exceed industry 
guidelines based on the on the specific category 
type.

Installation
To install the Nyquist ASB:
1.	 Ensure the  POWER switch is in the off position.
2.	 Connect the universal mains power line cord into 
the ASB.
3.	 Plug the power line cord into the power source.
4.	 Connect a Cat5 type cable into the Analog Station Bridge’s Ethernet port and ensure the other 
end of the  cable is 
correctly connected 
to your network.
5.	 Attach the desired 
speakers and their 
associated call 
switches to the ASB 
using West Penn 
357 cabling (or 
equivalent) and the 
pluggable connectors provided, where 
S terminals connect 
to the +/- speaker 
wires and the “G” 
and “A” terminals 
connect to the associated wires from 
the call switch.
=====

Notice
The combined impedance of the ASB’s 24 ports 
measured with an LCR bridge set to 500 Hz cannot 
be less than 4Ω . 
Zx represents the total number of speaker 
transformers connected to a given ASB. Measure 
the impedance of each transformer connected to 
the S/S terminals and plug it into the formula 
as 1/Z1, 1/Z2, etc. 
The 1/x key on a scientific calculator can be used 
to find the value of 1/Z Total.
A single port cannot exceed 40W. If all 24 ports are 
being used, each port cannot have more than 4W. 
The total power of all taps on all ports should not 
exceed 96W. 
6. If the Nyquist Digital Call Switch is being installed 
using the CAN Bus, refer to the Nyquist NQ-E7020 
Digital Call Switch Application Manual.
7. Press the POWER switch to power up the system.

Viewing and 
Understanding LEDs
Two LEDs appear on the 
front of the ASB. One 
is labeled POWER and 
appears as solid red during initial power up, flashes 
green during a boot sequence, and appears solid 
green when fully booted.
The STATUS LED uses the following indicators to 
provide information about the appliance:
•	
Flashing red – No network connection found.
•	
Solid blue – The ASB is in an uninitialized state 
and is not associated to a server. (The server 
may be in a discovery mode.)
•	
Solid green – The ASB is registered to a Nyquist 
server and is in normal operation.
•	
Flashing green – The ASB has an IP address but 
is not registered with the Nyquist server.
•	
Solid red – The ASB needs to be rebooted or reset so that the Nyquist application can resume.
•	
Flashing Blue – The ASB is updating.
