The I\/O Controller can be con-\nnected to a doorbell that, when pressed, sends a dashboard message \nto Admin Stations that someone wants to gain access through a \nsecured door. You or other Admin users can then select an Activate \nbutton that unlocks the door and allows entry to the secured area.\nIn this example, the dry contact connection of the doorbell would be \nwired to an I\/O Controller input terminal and the secured door\u2019s relay \nOn Time\nUse the down arrows to select the Minute and Second if \nthe Action is set for Hourly. When set to 00:00, hourly clo-\nsure is not enabled.\nDays\nSpecify the days of the week that the hourly closure of con-\ntact occurs.

{"context":"3 Managing Stations, \nZones, and Queues\n105\nManaging Stations, Zones, and \nQueues\nYou can divide your facility into zones to control paging and audio \nactivities or features. For example, suppose you want to allow the use \nof an audio source, such as a flash drive, in a cafeteria but prevent it \nfrom being played in a conference room. This feature, called audio \ndistribution, can be turned on by zone, so the cafeteria could be \nplaced in a zone that allows audio distribution while conference \nrooms would not be placed into that zone.\nNo limit exists for the number of zones or for the number of stations \nthat can be in a multicast zone. Performance limits do exist for unicast \nconnections.

The Information Technology (IT) depart-\nment for the site must whitelist the web addresses so that they can\nbe easily accessed as needed.\nThe following table lists the URLs that must be whitelisted.\nTable 1, Whitelisted Web Sites\nURL\nDescription\nhttp:\/\/hostedactivation.com (specifically, \nhttp:\/\/hostedactivation.com\/bogen)\nRequired for E7000 License support\nhttp:\/\/downloads.digium.com\nRequired for downloads from Digium \nPhone Module for Asterisk (DPMA)\nhttp:\/\/downloads.asterisk.org\/ (specifically, \nhttp:\/\/downloads.asterisk.org\/pub\/\ntelephony\/sounds\/releases)\nRequired for sounds download\nhttp:\/\/www.pjsip.org\/\nRequired for PJSIP download\nhttp:\/\/ftp.us.debian.org (specifically: http:\/\/\nftp.us.debian.org\/debian\/)\nRequired during Linux package installation\nhttp:\/\/security.debian.org (specifically: \nhttp:\/\/security.debian.org\/)\nRequired during Linux package installation\nstun01.sipphone.com\nRequired for STUN based IP address \nresolution (This is used by the E7000 Web \nUI and should be enabled on the computer \nthat runs the web UI.)\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhitelisting URLs for the E7000 system allows the site\u2019s IT department to enable access to essential web addresses required for installation and runtime operations, such as license support, software downloads, and necessary network services. This ensures that the E7000 can function properly without interruptions caused by blocked URLs.<|eot_id|>","token_count":570}

For example, if you want an \nannouncement to play after an alarm, you want to ensure that the \nZone-Page\nNote: This must \nbe the last action \nof the routine.\nDashboard mes-\nsages created \nduring the rou-\ntine will be \ndeleted when the \nuser disconnects \nthe call.\nZone\n\u2022\nSelected zone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nTable 13-5, Action Types and Parameters (Continued)\nType\nParameter 1\nParameter 2\nParameter 3\nParameter 4\nTable 13-6,  Email Address Formats for Cellular Carriers\nCellular Carrier\nFormat\nAT&T\n<phone number>@txt.att.net\nT-Mobile\n<phone number>@tmomail.net\nSprint\n<phone number>@messaging.sprintpcs.com\nVerizon\n<phone number>@vtext.com OR\n<phone number>@vzwpix.com\nVirgin Mobile\n<phone number>@vmobl.com","question":"What is required for sending an Email action to a cellphone?","answer":"To send an Email action to a cellphone, the cellular server provider must convert the email message to text.

Cloning an action \ncreates a duplicate of the selected action and places the duplicate at \nthe end of the action list.\nYou can edit a cloned action if you want to change any of the param-\neters, such as duration.\nTo clone an action:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nSelect Actions for the routine that has the action you \nwant to clone.\nStep 3\nSelect the Clone button (\n) for the action that you \nwant to duplicate.\n13.11.5\nUnderstanding Action Parameters\nAn action can have up to four parameters, depending on the Type \nselected. \nWhen viewing actions, the parameters appear as Parameter 1, \nParameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action \npage, though, the parameter names and available selections change \nbased on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field \ncalled Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the \ntones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see \"Viewing Avail-\nable Tones\u201d on page 256). With this type of action, you can also set \nthe Duration, which appears on the Actions page as Parameter 3. \nParameters 2 and 4 are not used for this type of action, but you can \nset a Finish Delay, which establishes if the routine should wait until \nthis action is completed before starting the next action.\nSome actions have no parameters. For example, if you select All-Call \nfor Type, no parameters are applicable.\nThe following table describes the action Type and any applicable \nparameters.\n407\nTable 13-5, Action Types and Parameters\nType\nParameter 1\nParameter 2\nParameter 3\nParameter 4\nAlarm\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done.\nAlarm\n\u2022\nSelected alarm\nNone\nDuration\n\u2022\nNumber of \nseconds for \naction to con-\ntinue; default is \n86400 seconds \n(24 hours)\nNone\nAll-Call\nNote: All-Call \nmust be the last \naction in a routine.\nIn addition to the \nparameters, you \ncan also set a Fin-\nish Delay, of \neither No-Delay \nor Wait-Until-\nDone.\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nAnnouncement\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done.\nAnnouncement\n\u2022\nSelected \nannouncement\nZone\n\u2022\nAll speakers\n\u2022\nSelected zone\nDuration\n\u2022\nNumber of \nseconds for \naction to con-\ntinue; default is \n86400 seconds \n(24 hours)\nNote: The \nannouncement \nwill stop when the \nduration length is \nreached, regard-\nless of the length \nof the announce-\nment.\nNone\nAudio-Dist-Start\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done\nAudio Distribution\n\u2022\nSelected Audio \nDistribution\nNone\nNone\nNone\n408\nAudio-Dist-Stop\nNote: In addition \nto the parame-\nters, you can also \nset a Finish Delay, \nof either No-\nDelay or Wait-\nUntil-Done\nAudio Distribution\n\u2022\nSelected Audio \nDistribution\n\u2022\nAll\nNone\nNone\nNone\nCall-And-\nAnnounce\nNumber to Call\n\u2022\n911\n\u2022\nStation Exten-\nsion\n\u2022\nA local 7-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 98\n\u2022\nA local 10-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 98\n\u2022\nA long dis-\ntance 10-digit \nphone num-\nber prefixed \nwith 981\nNote: If the speci-\nfied number to \ncall is not a station \nextension, then at \nleast one outgo-\ning SIP trunk or \nOutside Line \nDAHDI port must \nbe available, and \nthe CoS of the \nRoutine extension \nmust match the \nextension defined \nby the SIP trunk or \nOutside Line \nDAHDI port.\nAnnouncement to \nPlay\n\u2022\nSelected \nannouncement\nPlay Count\n\u2022\nContinuous \nPlay\n\u2022\nNumber of \ntimes to play\nNote: If left blank \nor set to zero (0), \nthe announce-\nment plays contin-\nuously until the \ncalled number \nhangs up.

SIP trunks can \ncarry VoIP calls, Enhanced 911, and other real-time communications \nservices. \nA SIP Tie-Trunk (or a SIP Tie-Line) functions similarly to a SIP trunk, \nbut serves as an IP based inter-connection between Nyquist and a \nlocal (premises-based) or hosted IP-PBX. For information about using \nSIP Tie-Trunks with Nyquist, refer to \"SIP Trunk Custom Configuration \nSettings\u201d on page 75.\nBefore you can set SIP parameters in Nyquist, you must first set up \nthe system's DISA function by creating a station with the Type of \nDISA Line.

In addition, Wireshark must be installed in \nthe Nyquist system server to allow packet inspection during SIP \nimplementation and troubleshooting. It is recommended that the \ntechnician performing the install be skilled with SIP implementation \nand testing. The Firewall setting must allow Port 5060 and Ports \n10000 \u2013 20000 for the RTP traffic. Any other type of SIP connectivity \ncould be available via an individual case basis process.\n68\n2.3.1\nHow Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls\nWhen a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on \nthat SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter \nset in the Nyquist SIP trunk\u2019s parameters. The Access parameter is set \nwhen editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see \"Editing a SIP \nTrunk Configuration\u201d on page 81 and \"Adding SIP Trunk Configuration \nParameters\u201d on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-\ntion.\nBased on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-\nlowing:\n\u2022 Routes the call to a DISA function\/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a Security DISA function\/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin\nThe following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the \nDISA functionality:\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 Password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 Password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password\nWhen the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will \nhear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any \nDual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a \nNyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller \ncan dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See \"Nyquist \nDTMF Feature Dialing Codes\u201d on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)\nWhen incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk \nExtension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type \nDISA Line; the associated station\u2019s CoS configuration is used to \ndetermine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed \nto initiate. (See \"Adding CoS Parameters for a Station\u201d on page 67.) \nNote: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-\ntem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are \nignored.","question":"What happens if a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist system?","answer":"If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist system, incoming calls from that SIP trunk are ignored.

Any other type of SIP connectivity \ncould be available via an individual case basis process.\n68\n2.3.1\nHow Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls\nWhen a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on \nthat SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter \nset in the Nyquist SIP trunk\u2019s parameters. The Access parameter is set \nwhen editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see \"Editing a SIP \nTrunk Configuration\u201d on page 81 and \"Adding SIP Trunk Configuration \nParameters\u201d on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-\ntion.\nBased on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-\nlowing:\n\u2022 Routes the call to a DISA function\/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a Security DISA function\/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin\nThe following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the \nDISA functionality:\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 Password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 Password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password\nWhen the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will \nhear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any \nDual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a \nNyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller \ncan dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See \"Nyquist \nDTMF Feature Dialing Codes\u201d on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)\nWhen incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk \nExtension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type \nDISA Line; the associated station\u2019s CoS configuration is used to \ndetermine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed \nto initiate. (See \"Adding CoS Parameters for a Station\u201d on page 67.) \nNote: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-\ntem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are \nignored.\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIf a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist system, incoming calls from that SIP trunk are ignored. This means no calls will be routed or processed by the Nyquist system until the SIP trunk is enabled.<|eot_id|>","token_count":1030}

On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone\/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication.

This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system.

Nyquist provides one key \n(located on the upper left) for user customizing, providing a \u201cspeed \ndialing\u201d option for a feature. For example, you can customize the \navailable line key to start a specific alarm. You can then select the line \nkey to start the alarm rather than using the steps described in \"Play-\ning Alarms\u201d on page 13.\nIf you do not want to use the Nyquist defaults for line keys, you can \nreserve line keys by creating and editing a reserve line key file \n(.rlkeys), provided you are not using the Nyquist System Controller. \nNote: Only routines with Allow DTMF enabled appear in the \nmenu.\nNote: Depending on the CoS settings for your Admin Phone, some \nof the line keys may appear blank. For example, if your Admin \nPhone does not have Execute Routines enabled through the CoS, \nthen the fourth key on the left, which by default is reserved by \nNyquist for Routines, has a blank label.\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nFrom an Admin Phone, you can manually launch a routine by dialing *94 followed by the Routine-DTMF-Code or by selecting the Routines menu and then choosing the routine you wish to launch. The ability to launch routines depends on the CoS configuration assigned to your Admin Phone.<|eot_id|>","token_count":780}

Cloning an action \ncreates a duplicate of the selected action and places the duplicate at \nthe end of the action list.\nYou can edit a cloned action if you want to change any of the param-\neters, such as duration.\nTo clone an action:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nSelect Actions for the routine that has the action you \nwant to clone.\nStep 3\nSelect the Clone button (\n) for the action that you \nwant to duplicate.\n13.11.5\nUnderstanding Action Parameters\nAn action can have up to four parameters, depending on the Type \nselected. \nWhen viewing actions, the parameters appear as Parameter 1, \nParameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action \npage, though, the parameter names and available selections change \nbased on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field \ncalled Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the \ntones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see \"Viewing Avail-\nable Tones\u201d on page 256). With this type of action, you can also set \nthe Duration, which appears on the Actions page as Parameter 3. \nParameters 2 and 4 are not used for this type of action, but you can \nset a Finish Delay, which establishes if the routine should wait until \nthis action is completed before starting the next action.\nSome actions have no parameters.

Cloning an action \ncreates a duplicate of the selected action and places the duplicate at \nthe end of the action list.\nYou can edit a cloned action if you want to change any of the param-\neters, such as duration.\nTo clone an action:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nSelect Actions for the routine that has the action you \nwant to clone.\nStep 3\nSelect the Clone button (\n) for the action that you \nwant to duplicate.\n13.11.5\nUnderstanding Action Parameters\nAn action can have up to four parameters, depending on the Type \nselected. \nWhen viewing actions, the parameters appear as Parameter 1, \nParameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action \npage, though, the parameter names and available selections change \nbased on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field \ncalled Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the \ntones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see \"Viewing Avail-\nable Tones\u201d on page 256).
