Each additional speaker in the row should \nuse this same spacing.\nRow 2 starts at twice the ceiling height distance from \nrow 1 and twice the ceiling height from the wall.  The \nother speakers in this row are also spaced at twice \nthe ceiling height.\nRow 3 is again spaced at twice the ceiling height from \nthe previous row. The first speaker starting this row is \npositioned at one ceiling height distance from the wall \n(similar to row 1). \nContinue this pattern of alternating rows until the room \nis covered.  The spacing of the speakers can be adjusted so that the speakers are evenly spaced in a row and \nare aesthetically pleasing.\nThe RE84 is an optional back box \nfor ceiling speakers. UL Listed for \nuse where ceiling plenum is part of \nan air handling system, the RE84 \nalso includes attachment tabs al\u00ad\nlowing the enclosure to be sup\u00ad\nported from structures other than \nthe actual ceiling grid.\nRE84\nRecessed\nEnclosure\nTB8\nTile \nBridge\nMR8\nMounting \nRing\nThe TB8 supports the weight of \nthe speaker and recessed enclo\u00ad\nsure.
