The System \nController offers high-performance operation for \neven the largest Nyquist system configurations and \ncan simultaneously distribute an unlimited number \nof audio streams anywhere across the network, \nmaking it perfect for background music applications.\nThe System Controller can manage applications \nthat require any mix of multi-zone paging, intercom\ncalling, or background music distribution at \nbusinesses, restaurants, retail stores, industrial \nfacilities, and many other venues.  It has a web-\nbased graphical user interface (GUI) that is \naccessible from almost any personal computer (PC), \ntablet, or mobile device. \n\nThe System Controller is designed to run on a \n10/100 Ethernet network.",
