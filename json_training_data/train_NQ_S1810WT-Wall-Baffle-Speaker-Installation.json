        "context": "NYQUIST VoIP Wall Baffle Speaker\nNQ-S1810WT Installation\nSpeaker Layout\nThe layout of the speakers should be planned \nprior to installation. Because wall baffle \nspeakers are designed to project for\u00ad\nward, it is best to aim them in the \nsame direction as this provides for \nboth greater coverage and clarity. You can use the building\u2019s \nroof pillars or other available supports for mounting the wall \nbaffles.\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to mount the wall baffles \non opposing walls. In these cases, the speakers will project \nsound in opposing directions.\nHALLWAY - Wall baffle speakers work well with rooms and hall\u00ad\nways that are 20\u2019 to 60\u2019 wide. Layout starts at one end of the \nhallway or room. The first speaker should be installed 10\u2019 from \nthe end of the hallway or room.  The next speaker on that wall \nshould be installed 20\u2019 from the first speaker. Each additional \nspeaker should be installed 20\u2019 apart from the previous one.\nThe first speaker on the opposing wall should be installed 20\u2019 \nfrom the end of the hallway or room, thereby staggering the \nspeakers. Each additional speaker should be installed 20\u2019 apart \nfrom the previous one (see Figure 1).\nROOMS - In most cases, an environment, such as a classroom, \nrequires only a single wall baffle speak\u00ad\ner to service the entire room. The final \nplacement of the speaker within the  \nroom can vary, but common area loca\u00ad\ntions such as at the head of the room \nor near the room entrance are typically \nchosen (see Figure 2).\nBased on the speaker position that \nhas been selected, you can choose between several mounting \noptions (see Figures 3-6).\nPublication Number 740-00011C 1811\nFigure 1\nFigure 2",
