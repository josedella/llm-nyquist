When the \nMCR system was being assembled at the factory, we installed the SSL certificate onto the laptop PC so that you don\u2019t have \nto. You can launch the Edge browser and go to System Controller\u2019s IP address of 172.31.1.1 and you will be presented with \nthe Dialing Length Wizard, and you will then need to complete the setup wizards and then log into the system and continue \nwith the system configuration (e.g., adding stations, zones, etc.).\nFor more information on how to properly configure a system refer to the Nyquist E7000 eLearning course.\nThings you don\u2019t need to worry about with the MCR is that the License Activation Key (LAK) and Customer Information has \nalready been populated in the system to save you time.
