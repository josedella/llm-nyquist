Designed \nto run on a 10/100 Ethernet network, the NQ-E7010 \nis IEEE 802.3af compliant and can be powered using \nPower-Over-Ethernet (PoE), or if that is not available, \nit can be powered via an optional\n48VDC 15W power adapter. The NQ-E7010 also \nhas a USB 2.0 host port, which is reserved for \nfuture use.\nInstallation\nThe NQ-E7010 can either be shelf or wall mounted.\n1.\t  Either place the I/O Controller appliance on a \nshelf, or use the supplied brackets to mount it \non a wall. \n2.\t  Wire the input terminal(s) to the dry contact connection(s) of the system/device(s) that you want \nto monitor with Nyquist. \n3.\t  Wire the open-collector output terminal(s) to the relay driver(s) of the system/device(s) that you \nwant to control via Nyquist.\n4.\t  Connect the device to the \n10/100 network using a \nCAT5 type cable. \nYou can now configure this device using the Nyquist web user \ninterface (UI) or the Nyquist I/O \nController web UI. Refer to the \nNyquist System Administrator \nManual or to the NQ-E7010 Input/Output Configuration Manual \nfor more information.\nPublication Number 740-00018C  1811",
