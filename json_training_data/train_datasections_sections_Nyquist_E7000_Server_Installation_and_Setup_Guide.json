While Option 1 is the quickest and \neasiest approach, Option 2 may be better suited for situations \nwhere high-availability server features like Redundant Array of \nIndependent Disks (RAID) or hot-swappable power supplies are \ndesired.\nThis manual describes the installation steps for Option 2.\nBefore installing Nyquist, ensure that:\n\u2022 Required services are enabled on your network. An example of a \nrequired service includes TFTP.\n\u2022 Required multicast IP addresses and ports are known and avail-\nable.\n\u2022 Required IP addresses are known and available.\n\u2022 Required port numbers are open.\nEnsure your server meets system requirements before beginning the \nDebian OS installation.\nNote: This manual provides the Nyquist E7000 installation process \nwhen using your own server.
