When used as a networked component \nof the Nyquist E7000 series paging and intercom \nsolution, the NQ-E7030 permits a \u201chybrid\u201d system \nconfiguration through use of 25V/70V speakers and \nassociated call switches (for example, Bogen CA15C \ntype). The ASB has 24 station connections that attach to speakers and their associated call switches. \nWhile each connection has its own Session Initiation \nProtocol (SIP) addressable Station ID, the ASB itself \nuses a single network IP address.\nWARNING: To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, \ndo not expose this apparatus to rain or moisture.\nAvertissement: pour r\u00e9duire le risque d\u2019incendie ou de \nchoc \u00e9lectrique, ne pas exposer cet appareil sous la \npluie et l\u2019humidit\u00e9.",
