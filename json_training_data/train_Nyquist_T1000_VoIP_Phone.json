An Emergency-All-Call page has a \nhigher priority than an All-Call or Normal page.\nTo make an Emergency-All-Call page:\nStep 1\nSelect the soft key labeled Directory.\nStep 2\nUse the navigation keys to select Paging and then \npress OK.\nStep 3\nUse the navigation keys to select All-Call-EMERGENCY \nand then press OK.\nStep 4\nTalk into the handset, or if using the speakerphone or \nheadset, talk into the microphone.\nStep 5\nHang up when finished.\n3.3\nRecord Page\nYou can record a page to be added to a zone queue. The maximum \nlength time for a recorded page is 60 minutes; if the recording\nexceeds 60 minutes, it will time out and not be saved. If the recording \nis silent for 60 seconds, it will time out and not be saved.\nPages in a zone\u2019s queue are played in the order that they are placed \nin the queue. A live page started on a zone that is playing a recorded \npage will cause the recorded page to be terminated and sent back to \nthe queue.

Multi-Site Emer-\ngency-All-Call, Multi-Site All-Call, Emergency All-Call, All-Call, Alarm, \nTone, and Emergency Announcement will also interrupt any queued \nmessages playing in any zones. All re-queued messages will play \nagain from the beginning of the message when the applicable zones \nbecome idle.\nSelecting Disable Audio will cause playback paging of all recorded \nmessages to stop. The messages will resume play from the beginning \nwhen audio is re-enabled.\nTo record a page for page queuing:\nStep 1\nSelect the soft key labeled Directory.\nStep 2\nUse the navigation keys to select Paging and then \npress OK.\nStep 3\nUse the navigation keys to select Record Page and \nthen press OK.\nStep 4\nWhen prompted, enter the queue number for the \nqueue that you want to page and press #.\nStep 5\nWait for the tone and then record your message.\nStep 6\nHang up when finished.\nNote: When the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a \nzone page, Nyquist will start recording a queued page if the zone \nbelongs to a queue.
