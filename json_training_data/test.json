The \n911 trigger Type can execute routines when any caller dials 911, so \nmultiple routines (one for each active 911 call) could execute.\nNote: The check and wait actions described in this section are \nalways related to the caller that triggered the routine. The routine \nsettings for Extension and Use Caller's Extension are not related \nto these wait actions; the check and wait actions will always be \nevaluated based on the trigger caller regardless of the routine's \nExtension or User Caller's Extension settings.\nNote: If you want to execute routine Actions after all stations have \nchecked in (Check-In status is Done), create a routine with trigger \nType set to Check-In and Parameter 1 set to Done.\n422\n13.11.7.4 Feature-Wait Action Type with Alarm\nIf you want to pause subsequent routine actions until the alarm fin-\nishes playing, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait \n(parameter 1) set to Alarm. If no alarm is playing when the Feature \nWait action executes, the routine does not wait for an alarm. Instead, \nit continues executing subsequent actions.\nIf you want to ensure that the routine includes an active alarm, use \nAlarm as the trigger Type (see \"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d \non page 395).\nIf you do not need the routine to wait until the alarm finishes, you can \nstill use Feature-Wait as the action Type and Alarm as Feature Wait \nand set Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) to the desired \namount of time to wait.\n13.11.7.5 Feature-Wait Action Type with Announcement\nIf you want all active Normal and Emergency announcements to \ncomplete before continue with subsequent routine actions, use the \nFeature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (parameter 1) set to \nAnnouncement.\nThis action will not allow you to specify which announcement type or \nwhich announcement to wait for. The Announcement trigger Type \ndoes allow you to specify an announcement type or number (see \n\"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d on page 395). However, if the \nroutine uses Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait set to \nAnnouncement and multiple announcements start, then the routine \nwill pause until all announcements have completed.\n13.11.7.6 Feature-Wait Action Type with All-Call\nIf you want a routine to pause until an active All-Call page completes, \nuse the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (parameter 1) \nset to All-Call.\nIf no All-Call page is playing when the Feature Wait action executes, \nthe routine does not wait for an All-Call page. Instead, it continues \nexecuting subsequent actions.\nIf you want to ensure that the routine includes an All-Call page, use \nAll-Call as the trigger Type.\nIf you do not need the routine to wait until the All-Call page finishes, \nyou can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and All-Call as\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo limit the wait time for alarms using the Feature-Wait action type, set the Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) to the desired amount of time. This allows the routine to continue executing subsequent actions after the specified wait time, even if the alarm has not finished playing.<|eot_id|>","token_count":990}

If the Admin Phone is associated \nwith an Admin Group, a call made to the Admin Phone when the \nphone is already on a call will automatically ring the Admin Group. \nIf the Admin Phone is not associated with an Admin Group and \n155\nreceives a call when already on a call, a beep sounds on the Admin \nPhone to indicate a call is on call waiting.\n\u2022 When you add two stations to an SPA112 device, you must enter \nthe same MAC address for both ports.\n\u2022 The station number with the lowest numerical value will be set up \non the first port (Phone 1) of the SPA112.\n\u2022 After you add or delete a second station to or from the SPA112, \nthe Nyquist system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist sys-\ntem server does not know the SPA112\u2019s IP address you must man-\nually reboot the SPA112 device for the changes to take effect on \nthe SPA112.\n\u2022 When a station is added to the SPA112, the web password is \nchanged to bogen. You can change the web password when add-\ning or editing the station.\n\u2022 If you configure two stations on the same SPA112, the web pass-\nword is set to the station with the highest station number, even if \nthe other station has a different web password defined. Ensure \nthat the same web password is entered for both stations on the \nSPA112.\n\u2022 When you delete the second station from the SPA112, the remain-\ning station is set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station \nwas previously set up on the second port (Phone 2).

This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX \ndefined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.\nThe steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-\npoint for an IP-PBX are:\n1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone\/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-\ntem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone\/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, \nthe username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system \nwill attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint \nextension using the provided username (extension) and password \npair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to \naccess the Nyquist system.\n2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-\ntem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system.

If All Facilities is selected, the remote routines start at the \nsame time.\n390\n13.8.1\nCall Detail Records\nCall Detail Records (CDRs) are created when a routine is started. \nWhen started on a local facility, the Destination field will show Local \nFacility and the Type field will show Start Routine (<routine-\nDTMF-code>).\nWhen a routine is started on a selected remote facility, the CDR will \nshow the remote facility name in the Destination field and Start \nRemote Routine (<routine-DTMF-code>) in the Type field.\nWhen a routine is started on all facilities, the CDR will show All Facil-\nities in the Destination field and Start Remote Routine (<routine-\nDTMF-code>) in the Type field.\nFor more information about view CDRs, see \"Viewing Call Detail \nRecords\u201d on page 319.\n13.9\nAllowing Input Contact Closure to Initiate \nRing-Tone to Speakers\nThrough the Routines feature, you can let an input contact closure \ninitiate the playing of a ringtone to designated stations. \nTo do this, create a routine (see \"Adding a Routine\u201d on page 387) that \nuses Play-Ringtone as the action Type (see \"Understanding Action \nParameters\u201d on page 406). For the Action, select Start. Select the \nZones that contain the speakers you want to play the ringtone.\nTo stop the ringtone, create a second routine that is triggered when \nthe contact opens and uses the Stop for the Action.\n13.10\nUsing Triggers\nA trigger is an event that starts a routine. By default, when you create \na routine, it has no trigger or actions.\nA trigger can have up to two parameters. For example, you can create \na trigger that uses a specific Announcement. The first parameter \nwould be the Announcement Type (Number) and the second \nparameter would be the Announcement.","question":"How can input contact closures be used to initiate ringtones on speakers?","answer":"Input contact closures can be used to initiate ringtones on speakers by creating a routine that utilizes the Play-Ringtone action type.

If you delete a routine and then \nrecreate it, you may need to assign a new DTMF Code if the previous \ncode was assigned to another routine.\nTo delete a routine:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nOn the Routines page, select the Delete icon next to \nthe routine that you want to delete.\nStep 3\nWhen prompted, select Delete.\n13.8\nCreating and Executing Multi-Site Routines\nYou can create a routine to be launched on one or more remote sites, \nsuch as a lockdown routine to be launched at all sites in a district.\nTo create such a routine, you would select the Routine action Type \n(see \"Actions\u201d on page 402 and \"Understanding Action Parameters\u201d on \npage 406). You can select to execute the action on the local facility, a \nspecific facility, or all facility. If you want to execute the routine or \nmultiple, but not all, facilities, you must create a separate action for \neach facility (using Routine action Type).\nWhen you select a specific facility, you can enter the DTMF code of \nthe routine. A routine with that DTMF code must exist on that facility.\nRoutines that are triggered by another site will not execute calling or \npaging type actions. Also, the receiving facility must have Use Caller \nExtension disabled.\nNote: There will be a one-second delay between execution of one \nRoutine action and another Routine action. So, if you execute a \nmulti-site routine for 10 sites, there will be 10-second delay \nbetween when the routine starts on the first facility and when it \nstarts on the tenth facility. To eliminate this delay, you can select \nAll Facilities and then ensure that a routine with the specified \nDTMF does not exist on the sites that you do not want to run the \nroutine.

Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system.

However, you cannot attach phones to just ports \n2, 5, and 10 since that combination does not include phone 1.\nThe following rules apply when adding a station to a Yeastar TA2400 \nport:\n\u2022 Device Type is Yeastar-TA2400 Analog FXS Port.\n\u2022 You can select Admin Phone or IP Phone for Type.\n\u2022 MAC Address is a required field. If you are adding the first station \nfor this MAC Address, the Port Number is automatically set to 1.\n\u2022 Paging is set to No and cannot be changed.\n\u2022 Multicast Audio Distribution is set to No but does not appear \non the Add Station or Edit Station pages.\n\u2022 Volume controls do not appear.\nNote: Port number 1 must always be used.\n161\n\u2022 Codecs Allowed is set to g722 and cannot be changed.\n\u2022 If you enter 1 for Port Number, the Admin Web UI displays the \nVLAN settings, Web Username, and Web Password fields.\n\u2022 Stations attached to the Yeastar TA2400 are not available for ring-\ning during Night Ring operations.\n\u2022 You can associate an external (classroom) speaker to a TA2400 \nport by selecting a Speaker Extension.\n\u2022 After adding a station, the Yeastar TA2400 must be manually \nrebooted via the Yeastar TA2400\u2019s web interface.\n\u2022 The Nyquist Appliances Network Time Server Source will be \nused to configure the Network Time Service on the Yeastar \nTA2400. (See \"Using the Yeastar TA2400\u201d on page 158.)\n\u2022 The Yeastar TA2400 time zone will be set to match the Nyquist \nserver\u2019s time zone.\n3.4.3.3\nViewing Yeastar TA2400 Status\nYou can use the Station Status feature to view overall status of the \nYeastar TA2400 device. (See \"Viewing Station Status\u201d on page 164.)\nYou can obtain status of the individual ports through the Yeastar \nTA2400 UI.\nTo view port status:\nStep 1\nFrom the Yeastar TA2400 web interface, select Status.\nStep 2\nSelect Port Status.\nParameters that can be viewed and a description of the \npossible statuses are described in the following table.\nFigure 3-19, FXS Port Status\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAfter adding a station to the Yeastar TA2400, the device must be manually rebooted via the Yeastar TA2400\u2019s web interface.

You can then select the line \nkey to start the alarm rather than using the steps described in \"Play-\ning Alarms\u201d on page 13.\nIf you do not want to use the Nyquist defaults for line keys, you can \nreserve line keys by creating and editing a reserve line key file \n(.rlkeys), provided you are not using the Nyquist System Controller. \nNote: Only routines with Allow DTMF enabled appear in the \nmenu.\nNote: Depending on the CoS settings for your Admin Phone, some \nof the line keys may appear blank. For example, if your Admin \nPhone does not have Execute Routines enabled through the CoS, \nthen the fourth key on the left, which by default is reserved by \nNyquist for Routines, has a blank label.\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn Admin Phone can end a launched routine with the following page commands: All-Call, Emergency-All-Call, Facility-Page, Multi-Site-All-Call, and Multi-Site-Emergency-All-Call, provided the Admin Phone has the appropriate Class of Service (CoS) enabled.<|eot_id|>","token_count":784}

Pink noise sounds less harsh than white noise because \nhumans hear in octaves (the doubling of a frequency band). The \nenergy in pink noise decreases by half as the frequency doubles, \nmaking the noise sound more balanced.\nBoth white and pink noise files are provided by default in Nyquist as \nboth tones and songs. You can use the tone files as a tone generator \nto help adjust volume and frequency for pages in time-based zones. \nYou can use the song files to help adjust volume and frequency in \naudio zones that play audio distribution.\nRemember that when creating, editing, or viewing a zone, the Type \nidentifies the zone as being able to receive paging, time, audio, or a \ncombination of paging, time, or audio.

It allows you to use VoIP tele-\nphony beyond the facility\u2019s firewall without the need for a Public \nSwitched Telephone Network (PSTN), providing a configuration that \nis easier and less expensive to operate and maintain. SIP trunks can \ncarry VoIP calls, Enhanced 911, and other real-time communications \nservices. \nA SIP Tie-Trunk (or a SIP Tie-Line) functions similarly to a SIP trunk, \nbut serves as an IP based inter-connection between Nyquist and a \nlocal (premises-based) or hosted IP-PBX. For information about using \nSIP Tie-Trunks with Nyquist, refer to \"SIP Trunk Custom Configuration \nSettings\u201d on page 75.\nBefore you can set SIP parameters in Nyquist, you must first set up \nthe system's DISA function by creating a station with the Type of \nDISA Line. (See \"Adding a Station\u201d on page 153.)\nIf you will require support from Bogen during the implementation \nprocess, you must install Teamviewer on the Nyquist system server \nand enable Remote access capabilities in the LAN to allow a remote \nconnection to the server. In addition, Wireshark must be installed in \nthe Nyquist system server to allow packet inspection during SIP \nimplementation and troubleshooting. It is recommended that the \ntechnician performing the install be skilled with SIP implementation \nand testing. The Firewall setting must allow Port 5060 and Ports \n10000 \u2013 20000 for the RTP traffic. Any other type of SIP connectivity \ncould be available via an individual case basis process.\n68\n2.3.1\nHow Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls\nWhen a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on \nthat SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter \nset in the Nyquist SIP trunk\u2019s parameters. The Access parameter is set \nwhen editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see \"Editing a SIP \nTrunk Configuration\u201d on page 81 and \"Adding SIP Trunk Configuration \nParameters\u201d on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-\ntion.\nBased on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-\nlowing:\n\u2022 Routes the call to a DISA function\/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a Security DISA function\/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin\nThe following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the \nDISA functionality:\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 Password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 Password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password\nWhen the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will \nhear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any \nDual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a \nNyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller \ncan dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See \"Nyquist \nDTMF Feature Dialing Codes\u201d on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)\nWhen incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk \nExtension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type \nDISA Line; the associated station\u2019s CoS configuration is used to \ndetermine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed \nto initiate.

If the call was not answered \n(no active intercom call), the routine terminates. Otherwise, it exe-\ncutes additional actions before waiting for the call to finish (Inter-\ncom-Wait action Type), and then when the call is finished, the routine \nexecutes the remaining actions.\n421\n13.11.7.2 Check-In Action Type with Check In Set to Wait\nWhen the routine includes a Check-In action Type and Check-In \n(parameter 1) is Wait, the routine pauses the execution of subse-\nquent actions until the Check-in process is no longer active. When \nthe Check-In process is Finished or you select Stop, Finish, or Reset, \nthe routine resumes executing actions that follow a finished Check-In \nprocess such as: announcing Check-In completed to Admin Station \nspeakers or displaying Check-in completion messages on web inter-\nface dashboards or GA10PV displays. \nCheck-In action Type with Check-In set to Wait does not differenti-\nate between the Check-in process moving to the Finished state or \nhaving been manually stopped or finished.\nFor more information about the Check-In process, see \"Manage \nCheck-In\u201d on page 409.\n13.11.7.3 Feature-Wait Action Type with 911\nYou may want to include the Feature-Wait action Type in a routine \nthat is triggered by a 911 call to pause subsequent actions until the \n911 call ends. In this scenario, set Feature Wait (parameter 1 of the \nFeature-Wait action Type) to 911.\nAfter the 911 call ends, the routine executes subsequent actions. The \n911 trigger Type can execute routines when any caller dials 911, so \nmultiple routines (one for each active 911 call) could execute.\nNote: The check and wait actions described in this section are \nalways related to the caller that triggered the routine. The routine \nsettings for Extension and Use Caller's Extension are not related \nto these wait actions; the check and wait actions will always be \nevaluated based on the trigger caller regardless of the routine's \nExtension or User Caller's Extension settings.\nNote: If you want to execute routine Actions after all stations have \nchecked in (Check-In status is Done), create a routine with trigger \nType set to Check-In and Parameter 1 set to Done.\n        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo execute actions after all stations have completed their check-in, configure a routine with the trigger Type set to Check-In and Parameter 1 set to Done. This ensures that the actions will only execute once the Check-In status is marked as Done for all stations.<|eot_id|>","token_count":1022}
