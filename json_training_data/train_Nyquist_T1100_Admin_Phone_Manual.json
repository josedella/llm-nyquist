For example, you can customize the \navailable line key to start a specific alarm. You can then select the line \nkey to start the alarm rather than using the steps described in \"Play-\ning Alarms\u201d on page 13.\nIf you do not want to use the Nyquist defaults for line keys, you can \nreserve line keys by creating and editing a reserve line key file \n(.rlkeys), provided you are not using the Nyquist System Controller. \nNote: Only routines with Allow DTMF enabled appear in the \nmenu.\nNote: Depending on the CoS settings for your Admin Phone, some \nof the line keys may appear blank. For example, if your Admin \nPhone does not have Execute Routines enabled through the CoS, \nthen the fourth key on the left, which by default is reserved by \nNyquist for Routines, has a blank label.",
