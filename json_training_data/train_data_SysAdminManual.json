Users can log in to the E7000 system using the Google \nChrome web browser from a computer or tablet running either a \nWindows 8.1 (or later) or a Mac OS X 10.12.x (or later) operating \nsystem (OS). The UI can also be accessed via a Chrome browser \nenabled Android-based tablet or mobile device. To access the server, \ntype your server\u2019s IP address (for example, 10.10.20.12).\n1.1.1\nWhitelisted Web Addresses\nE7000 requires access to specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), \ncommonly referred to as web addresses. Access to many of these \nweb addresses is required during installation; access to other web \naddresses, such as the address for the Network Time Server (NTS) are \nrequired during runtime. The Information Technology (IT) depart-\nment for the site must whitelist the web addresses so that they can \nbe easily accessed as needed.\nThe following table lists the URLs that must be whitelisted.\nTable 1-1, Whitelisted Web Sites\nURL\nDescription\nhttp://hostedactivation.com (specifically, \nhttp://hostedactivation.com/bogen)\nRequired for E7000 License support\nhttp://downloads.digium.com\nRequired for downloads from Digium \nPhone Module for Asterisk (DPMA)\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/ (specifically, \nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/\ntelephony/sounds/releases)\nRequired for sounds download\nhttp://www.pjsip.org/\nRequired for PJSIP download\nhttp://ftp.us.debian.org (specifically: http://\nftp.us.debian.org/debian/)\nRequired during Linux package installation\nhttp://security.debian.org (specifically: \nhttp://security.debian.org/)\nRequired during Linux package installation",

An analog \nphone cannot be used as a Night Ring Admin even if the \nstation has the admin Class of Service (CoS) enabled.\nNight Ring All Stations\nIndicates if all stations receive night rings during night \nhours. When enabled, any ringing station can answer the \ncall. The specified stations will ring for up to 30 minutes, \nthen hang up if the call is not answered within that time.\nNote: NQ-P0100 Matrix Mixer Pre-Amp stations will also \nring.\nNight Ring Admin \nGroup\nIdentifies the Admin Group that handles outside line calls \nreceived during night hours. The Admin Group is called if \nthe Night Admin and Night Ring Admin do not answer \nwithin 15 seconds. The specified stations will ring for up to \n30 minutes, then hang up if the call is not answered within \nthat time.\nTable 2-1,  System Parameters Page (Continued)\n29\nNight Ring Zones\nIdentifies which zones receive night rings when outside \ncalls are received during night hours. The specified stations \nwill ring for up to 30 minutes, then hang up if the call is not \nanswered within that time.\nServer IP Address\nIdentifies the server\u2019s IP address. To change the server\u2019s IP \naddress, select Change Server IP Address and then select \nthe correct IP address from the menu that appears.\nParking Lot\nDefines the range of numbers to use for call parking. The \nfirst number listed is used to initiate call parking, which is a \nfeature that allows you to put a call on hold at one tele-\nphone set and continue the conversation from any other \ntelephone set.\nRecord Monitoring\nIndicates if call and location monitoring will be recorded.\nEmergency Link\nSpecifies the station that functions as the system\u2019s Emer-\ngency Link Station. An Emergency Link Station is the station \nthat an emergency call (but not a 911 call) is routed to if the \nstation\u2019s associated Admin Station is busy, rejects the call, \nor fails to answer within 15 seconds. A value of 999 means \nthat this feature is disabled.\nIf the Emergency Link Station is a ringable device (a Nyquist \nphone), the station will ring and the call will be displayed \non the station\u2019s display (if so equipped) as an \u201cEmergency \nCall.\u201d If the Emergency Link Station is not a ringable device \n(a Nyquist VoIP speaker), the station will auto-answer, pre-\nannouncing the call as an \u201cEmergency.\u201d The Admin Station \nwill continue to ring if an emergency call is auto-answered \nby a non-ringable Emergency Link Station device. The \nAdmin Station can retrieve the call by answering it, and the \nEmergency Link Station device will then drop the call. As \nwith any Emergency Call, all calls to an Emergency Link Sta-\ntion will be recorded.\nMax Restricted Digits\nSpecifies the maximum number of digits that can be dialed \nif a station has been assigned restricted outside line access.\nCDR Storage Duration\nIdentifies the number of days that a record of call details \nwill be kept. CDR is an acronym for Call Detail Record.\nTrunk Priority\nIdentifies the first trunk type to use for placing outbound \ncalls.\nTable 2-1,  System Parameters Page (Continued)\n30\nBump on Emergency\nIndicates if emergency calls to the Admin Station will bump \nexisting non-emergency calls.\nBump on 911\nIndicates if outbound calls to 911 will bump trunk calls if no \navailable outbound trunk is available.\nAllow Local Emer-\ngency-All-Call Page \nInterrupt\nWhen enabled, allows an Emergency-All-Call page to be \ninterrupted after the user enters a PIN.\nAllow Multi-Site-Emer-\ngency-All-Call Inter-\nrupt\nWhen enabled, Emergency-All-Call pages can be inter-\nrupted by Multi-Site-Emergency-All-Call pages.\nAuth Code\nAllows you to enable additional features on a telephone \nwhen the walking CoS feature is enabled. The four-digit \ncode activates features from the associated phone to the \nphone being used. (Auth is an abbreviation for Authoriza-\ntion.) If set to 0000, the walking CoS feature is disabled.\nCall Assurance Audio\nIdentifies the audio to be played to the caller to indicate \nthat the call has been placed.\nRemote Facility CoS\nIdentifies the CoS for remote facility access.\nFacility Password\nIdentifies the password to be used by facility servers that \nare registering with this server. The maximum password size \nis 12 characters.\nRTP Start Port\nIdentifies the start port number for UDP RTP traffic. The \ndefault is 10000.\nRTP End Port\nIdentifies the stop port number for UDP RTP traffic. The \ndefault is 20000.\nEnable RTP Checksums\nIndicates if UDP checksums are enabled for RTP traffic.\nEnable ICE Support\nIndicates if ICE support is enabled.\nNote: Disabling ICE support could result in audio issues when making \ncalls using the Web Interface.\nSTUN Server\nIdentifies the host name or IP address for the STUN server \nthat is used when determining the external IP address and \nport for an RTP session. (Port number is optional.) If omit-\nted, the default value of 3478 is used.\nTable 2-1,  System Parameters Page (Continued)\n31\n2.1.1.2\nSetting Night Call Options\nThe way outside calls received during nighttime hours are handled \ndepends on how you set up the Night Ring options on the System \nParameters page. (See \"Using the System Parameters Page\u201d on \npage 24.) The following diagram illustrates how settings for these \noptions affect night calls.\nTURN Server\nIdentifies the host name or IP address for the TURN server \nthat is to be used as a relay. (Port number is optional.) If \nomitted, the default value of 3478 will be used.\nTURN Username\nIdentifies the user name used to authenticate with the \nTURN server.\nTURN Password\nIdentifies the password used to authenticate with the TURN \nserver.\nRetention Recordings\nIdentifies the number of days to retain recordings. Record-\nings that are older than the retention period are automati-\ncally deleted.\nBackup Retention \nSystem\nIdentifies the number of days to retain system backup files. \nSystem backups that are older than the retention period are \nautomatically deleted, provided at least one system backup \nfile remains.\nBackup Retention \nRecordings\nIdentifies the number of days that backups of recordings \nare retained. Backups that are older than the retention \nperiod are automatically deleted.\nBackup Retention \nVoicemail\nIdentifies the number of days that voicemail backups are \nretailed.

It allows you to use VoIP tele-\nphony beyond the facility\u2019s firewall without the need for a Public \nSwitched Telephone Network (PSTN), providing a configuration that \nis easier and less expensive to operate and maintain. SIP trunks can \ncarry VoIP calls, Enhanced 911, and other real-time communications \nservices. \nA SIP Tie-Trunk (or a SIP Tie-Line) functions similarly to a SIP trunk, \nbut serves as an IP based inter-connection between Nyquist and a \nlocal (premises-based) or hosted IP-PBX. For information about using \nSIP Tie-Trunks with Nyquist, refer to \"SIP Trunk Custom Configuration \nSettings\u201d on page 75.\nBefore you can set SIP parameters in Nyquist, you must first set up \nthe system's DISA function by creating a station with the Type of \nDISA Line. (See \"Adding a Station\u201d on page 153.)\nIf you will require support from Bogen during the implementation \nprocess, you must install Teamviewer on the Nyquist system server \nand enable Remote access capabilities in the LAN to allow a remote \nconnection to the server. In addition, Wireshark must be installed in \nthe Nyquist system server to allow packet inspection during SIP \nimplementation and troubleshooting. It is recommended that the \ntechnician performing the install be skilled with SIP implementation \nand testing. The Firewall setting must allow Port 5060 and Ports \n10000 \u2013 20000 for the RTP traffic. Any other type of SIP connectivity \ncould be available via an individual case basis process.\n68\n2.3.1\nHow Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls\nWhen a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on \nthat SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter \nset in the Nyquist SIP trunk\u2019s parameters. The Access parameter is set \nwhen editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see \"Editing a SIP \nTrunk Configuration\u201d on page 81 and \"Adding SIP Trunk Configuration \nParameters\u201d on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-\ntion.\nBased on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-\nlowing:\n\u2022 Routes the call to a DISA function/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station\n\u2022 Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin\nThe following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the \nDISA functionality:\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 Password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 No password\n\u2022 DISA \u2013 Incoming only \u2013 Password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password\n\u2022 PBX Connection \u2013 Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password\nWhen the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will \nhear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any \nDual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a \nNyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller \ncan dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See \"Nyquist \nDTMF Feature Dialing Codes\u201d on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)\nWhen incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk \nExtension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type \nDISA Line; the associated station\u2019s CoS configuration is used to \ndetermine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed \nto initiate. (See \"Adding CoS Parameters for a Station\u201d on page 67.) \nNote: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-\ntem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are \nignored.",

This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX \ndefined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.\nThe steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-\npoint for an IP-PBX are:\n1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-\ntem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, \nthe username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system \nwill attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint \nextension using the provided username (extension) and password \npair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to \naccess the Nyquist system.\n2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-\ntem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX \nNote: The station extension used for the DISA Line must be differ-\nent than the extension being used by your IP-PBX.",

This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX \ndefined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.\nThe steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-\npoint for an IP-PBX are:\n1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-\ntem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-\npoint as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone \nwith a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, \nthe username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system \nwill attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint \nextension using the provided username (extension) and password \npair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to \naccess the Nyquist system.\n2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-\ntem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station\u2019s extension will \ndefine the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX \ncalls into the Nyquist system. \n3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP \nTrunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was \ndefined on your IP-PBX in step 1.\nFor example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the \nSIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk \nmust use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the \nAdd SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a \nDISA station. \nWhen an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-\ning call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-\nsion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the \nNyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to \ninitiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX \nNote: The station extension used for the DISA Line must be differ-\nent than the extension being used by your IP-PBX.\n77\nuser hears a dial tone. The IP-PBX user can then enter DTMF/dial-pad \nbased feature commands to start paging and other Nyquist features.\nTable 2-12,  Nyquist SIP Trunk Configuration\nName\n511\n(Username/extension provided by IP-PBX)\nExtension\n500\n(DISA station extension defined on the \nNyquist system.

The I/O Controller can be con-\nnected to a doorbell that, when pressed, sends a dashboard message \nto Admin Stations that someone wants to gain access through a \nsecured door. You or other Admin users can then select an Activate \nbutton that unlocks the door and allows entry to the secured area.\nIn this example, the dry contact connection of the doorbell would be \nwired to an I/O Controller input terminal and the secured door\u2019s relay \nOn Time\nUse the down arrows to select the Minute and Second if \nthe Action is set for Hourly. When set to 00:00, hourly clo-\nsure is not enabled.\nDays\nSpecify the days of the week that the hourly closure of con-\ntact occurs. This parameter appears only if the Action is set \nto Hourly.\nZones\nSpecify which paging zones trigger the output contact clo-\nsure if the Action is set to Page. If left blank, any zones \nstarted trigger the output contact closure.\nTones\nSpecify which tone to play if the Action is set to Tone.\nAnnouncements\nSpecify which announcement to play if the Action is set to \nAnnouncement.\nAlarms\nSpecify which alarm to play if the Action is set to Alarm.\nProgram Distribution\nSpecify which audio distribution file to play if the Action is \nset to Audio.\nDuration\nProvide the duration of the contact closure in milliseconds. \nA value of 0 leaves the contact closed.\nControl Stations\nSelect the stations that can manually control the output \ncontact. A button for manually setting the output contact \nappears on the dashboard.\nClose Button Label\nProvide a label for the Dashboard button that is associated \nwith the closing of an output contact. The duration for the \ncontact must be set to 0 for this label to appear.\nOpen Button Label\nProvide a label for the Dashboard button that is associated \nwith the opening of an output contact. The duration for the \ncontact must be set to 0 for this label to appear.\nTable 3-4,  Output Contact Rule Parameters (Continued)\n134\ndriver would be wired to an I/O Controller\u2019s output terminal. (Refer to \nNYQUIST Input/Output Controller NQ-E7010 Installation and Use.)\nFollow the steps for configuring an I/O Controller Input Configure \nRule (see \"Configuring I/O Controller Input Rules\u201d on page 126) using \nthe following parameters:\n\u2022 For Close Interval, enter how long (in milliseconds) the input \ncontact must remain closed before the input action is triggered. \n\u2022 For Action, select Other.\n\u2022 For Close Extension, select that extension, or station number, \nfor the I/O Controller connected to the output contact that, \nwhen closed, will open the door.\n\u2022 For Close Contact, select the Output Contact # that is to be \nclosed when Activate is pressed on the dashboard message.\n\u2022 For Duration, enter the number of milliseconds required for the \ndoor open circuit to open the door.\n\u2022 For Dashboard Type, select io-contact.\n\u2022 For Dashboard Title, enter a title for the dashboard popup \nmessage (for example, Front Door).\n\u2022 For Dashboard Text, enter the message that you want dis-\nplayed on the dashboard popup message (for example, Front \ndoorbell activated; press \u201cActivate\u201d to open the front door.\n\u2022 For Dashboard Style, select basic.\nWhen configured properly, the doorbell sounds and a message \nappears when the doorbell is pressed. \nFigure 3-4, Example of Dashboard Message\n135\nIf you select Activate, the door opens. If you select Ignore, the door \nremains closed and the popup message disappears.\n3.2.4\nViewing an I/O Controller Schedule\nYou can view all contact closures set for specific dates and times \nusing the Configure Schedule button on the I/O Controller\u2019s Edit Sta-\ntion page.

If the Admin Phone is associated \nwith an Admin Group, a call made to the Admin Phone when the \nphone is already on a call will automatically ring the Admin Group. \nIf the Admin Phone is not associated with an Admin Group and \n155\nreceives a call when already on a call, a beep sounds on the Admin \nPhone to indicate a call is on call waiting.\n\u2022 When you add two stations to an SPA112 device, you must enter \nthe same MAC address for both ports.\n\u2022 The station number with the lowest numerical value will be set up \non the first port (Phone 1) of the SPA112.\n\u2022 After you add or delete a second station to or from the SPA112, \nthe Nyquist system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist sys-\ntem server does not know the SPA112\u2019s IP address you must man-\nually reboot the SPA112 device for the changes to take effect on \nthe SPA112.\n\u2022 When a station is added to the SPA112, the web password is \nchanged to bogen. You can change the web password when add-\ning or editing the station.\n\u2022 If you configure two stations on the same SPA112, the web pass-\nword is set to the station with the highest station number, even if \nthe other station has a different web password defined. Ensure \nthat the same web password is entered for both stations on the \nSPA112.\n\u2022 When you delete the second station from the SPA112, the remain-\ning station is set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station \nwas previously set up on the second port (Phone 2). If this situa-\ntion occurs, move the attached phone cable from Phone 2 to \nPhone 1.\n\u2022 When you configure two stations on the same SPA112, the second \nstation (Phone 2) uses port # 5061.\n\u2022 It can take several minutes for changes to show up on the \nSPA112\u2019s web interface when adding, modifying, or deleting sta-\ntions to or from an SPA112.\n\u2022 When you add a station to an SPA 112 for the first time, you must \nreboot the SPA112 after adding the station with the Nyquist web \nUI before the SPA112 will retrieve its configuration information.\n\u2022 If station VLAN settings are provided and two stations are defined \non the SPA112, the VLAN settings from the station with the lowest \nstation number are used. The best practice is to ensure that both \nstations on the SPA112 use the same VLAN settings.\n156\nRefer to the Cisco Small Business SPA100 Series Phone Adapters \nAdministration Guide for instructions on connecting the ATA.\nTo add a Cisco SPA112 station:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Stations.\nStep 2\nSelect the Add icon.\nStep 3\nComplete the configuration parameters for the new \nstation:\na\nFor Type, select Admin Phone or IP Phone.\nb\nFor Device Type, select Cisco SPA112.\nc\nFor MAC Address, enter the MAC address of the \nCisco SPA112.\nFor all other parameters, see \"Station Configuration \nPage Parameters\u201d on page 107.\nStep 4\nSelect Save.\nStep 5\nFrom your web browser, enter the IP address of the \nCisco SPA112 device.\nStep 6\nLog into the device.\nNote: If Use Network Time Server defined by DHCP is set to Yes on \nthe Nyquist system server, the Cisco SPA112\u2019s NTP server configu-\nration is not changed; otherwise the device\u2019s NTP server is set to \nthe Nyquist system server\u2019s defined NTP server.\nFigure 3-16, Cisco SPA112 Logon Window\n157\nStep 7\nSelect the Voice tab, and then select Provisioning.\nStep 8\nSet Transport Protocol to tftp, and then select Sub-\nmit.\nStep 9\nSelect the Administrator tab, and then select Reboot \nto reboot the device.\nStep 10\nLog into the device.

Valid values are 1 through 24. \nIf you have only one phone attached to the TA2400, it must be \nattached to port 1. If you have multiple phones attached to the \nTA2400, one must be attached to port 1 but the use of the other \nports can be random. For example, you can have phones attached to \nport 1, 2, 5, and 10. However, you cannot attach phones to just ports \n2, 5, and 10 since that combination does not include phone 1.\nThe following rules apply when adding a station to a Yeastar TA2400 \nport:\n\u2022 Device Type is Yeastar-TA2400 Analog FXS Port.\n\u2022 You can select Admin Phone or IP Phone for Type.\n\u2022 MAC Address is a required field.

With page queuing, the page does not start until you (or \nthe user recording the page) has indicated that the recording is com-\npleted.\nPage Queuing also prevents page overlapping since pages sent to a \nqueue play one at a time.\nThe Page Queuing feature differs from the Schedule Announcement \n(see \"Using the Schedule Announcement Feature\u201d on page 239) and \nRecord Announcement (see \"Monitoring/Recording\u201d on page 479) \nfeatures. The Schedule Announcement feature allows you to specify a \ndate and time when the announcement is to be played, and the \nDTMF Code *990 allows a user to use the admin phone to record an \nannouncement that is played immediately after it is recorded. \nUsing the DTMF Codes *991 or *991*{Zone Number} or selecting \nRecord Page from the Admin Phone or the Admin web UI allows you \nto initiate a queued page. \nWhen the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a zone \npage, Nyquist will start a queued page if the zone belongs to a \nqueue. If you want to start a real-time page to the zone instead, dial \n#{Zone Number}*.\nWith the Page Queuing feature, the recorded page is placed in a \nzone\u2019s queue. The pages in the zone\u2019s queue are played in the order \nthat they are placed in the queue.\nA live page started on a zone that is playing a recorded page will \ncause the recorded page to be terminated and sent back to the \nqueue. The interrupted message will play again, from the beginning \n175\nof the message, when the zone becomes idle. Multi-Site Emergency-\nAll-Call, Multi-Site All-Call, Emergency All-Call, All-Call, Alarm, Tone, \nand Emergency Announcement will also interrupt any playing \nrecorded zone messages. All re-queued interrupted messages will \nplay again, from the beginning of the message, when the zones \nbecomes idle.\nSelecting Disable Audio will cause all recorded messages to stop. \nThe messages will resume play from the beginning when audio is re-\nenabled. \nFor information about recording pages, see \"Record Page\u201d on \npage 334.\nTo view existing queues:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, expand Zones and Queues.\nStep 2\nSelect Queues.\nQueue information is described in the following table:\nFigure 3-25, Queues\nTable 3-16,  Queues Page Parameters\nNumber\nNumber that the user assigns to the queue\nName\nName that the user assigns to the queue\n176\n3.13\nAdding a Queue\nYou can create multiple queues for stacking pages, and a queue may \nhave one or more zones. However, a zone can only be associated \nwith a single queue.\nWarning\nChanges to queues \u2013 including adding a queue, modi-\nfying an existing queue, or deleting a queue \u2013 will\nresult in the deletion of all recorded pages that have\nnot yet played. Changes should only be done after\nbusiness hours or during a small maintenance window\nthat does not exceed 5 minutes.\nDelay Between \nMessages\nNumber of seconds to pause between pages. \nThe delay can range between 1 and 10 sec-\nonds. The default is 2 seconds. \nMessage Plays\nHow many times each page in the queue will \nplay. The number can range between 1 and \n3. The default is 1, which means that the \nmessage plays only one time.\nZones\nSelect Show when viewing a queue to see \nthe list of zones assigned to the queue. \nWhen adding a queue, only zones not \nalready assigned to a queue and that are \nPaging, Paging+Time, Paging+Audio, and \nPaging+Time+Audio type appear in the \ndrop-down menu.\nNote: A zone can only be associated to a sin-\ngle queue.\nTable 3-16,  Queues Page Parameters (Continued)",

It involves creating a playlist or selecting an input \nsource and specifying which zones or stations hear the playlist or \ninput source. Through the Scheduled Audio feature, audio distribu-\ntion can be tied to a specific event in a schedule. For information \nabout the Scheduled Audio feature, \"Understanding Event Settings\u201d \non page 228.\nNote: Before using the Audio Distribution feature, make sure that \nstations and zones have been configured and that the station you \nare using to launch Audio Distribution has the appropriate Class of \nService (CoS) parameters set.\nNote: If an audio distribution playlist that has a station assigned to \nit is playing, you cannot play another audio distribution playlist \nwith a station assigned.\n354\nTo create an audio distribution:\nStep 1\nIf not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard \nfrom the navigation bar.\nStep 2\nSelect the Add icon.\nStep 3\nUse the Line-Input/Playlist/Source drop-down menu \nto select the audio source.\nStep 4\nSelect the Zones and Stations.\nStep 5\nIf you select Line-Input as the Input Source/Playlist, \nselect the Amplifiers/Matrix Mixers and Input Chan-\nnel.\nStep 6\nIf you select a playlist and want to shuffle the song \norder, set Shuffle to Yes.\nStep 7\nSelect Save.\nStep 8\nTo end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next \nto the playlist.\nFigure 11-18, Create an Audio Distribution\nNote: If you are using at least one Nyquist Matrix Mixer Pre-Amp, \nLine-Input appears as a Input Source/Playlist option.\n355\nTo launch a previously created audio distribution:\nStep 1\nIf not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard \nfrom the navigation bar.\nStep 2\nSelect the Play icon next to the audio distribution that \nyou want to launch.\nStep 3\nTo end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next \nto the playlist.\nAn existing Audio Distribution can be edited or deleted, \nprovided it is not currently playing or linked to a rou-\ntine, by selecting the Edit or Delete icon next to the \nAudio Distribution.\nWhen Audio Distribution is enabled, an informational message \nappears in the Messages window of the Admin Web UI dashboard, \nindicating the song that is currently playing and to which speakers \n(all or selected) and to which zones audio is playing to.\nAudio distribution will be paused automatically by higher priority fea-\nture activation (for example, All-Call Page, Paging, Tones) and will \nautomatically resume when the higher priority feature is finished.\nWhen another system feature pauses Audio Distribution, the mes-\nsage on the dashboard messages window includes PAUSED to \nremind you that Audio Distribution is still enabled but is currently \npaused.\nAudio Distribution may also be started or stopped using Admin \nPhones. (Audio Distribution is available on the Admin Phone by \nselecting Directory and then selecting Features.)\nIf you select Set after making selections in the Audio Distribution \npanel of the dashboard, the displayed settings are updated on the \nserver to allow Admin IP Phones to start Audio Distribution using the \ndisplayed settings. Selecting Set only updates the settings; it does \nnot start the audio distribution.\nAudio Distribution volume can be changed by setting Audio Distri-\nbution Volume, available in System Parameters. \nAll Nyquist stations are pre-programmed to receive Audio Distribu-\ntion to All Stations.

You can also \ncreate buttons to open a URL or execute a previously created routine.\nTo use the Maps feature, you must have the appropriate permissions \n(see \"Assigning Maps Panel Permissions\u201d on page 361).\nWhen setting maps up in a Nyquist system environment, you can \nimport JPEG or PNG graphics of your facility, buildings, rooms, or \nobjects, such as icons or landmarks. You can then set up various \ndefined action objects. Action objects are interactive shapes on the \nmap that allow the launching of intercom calls or zone pages.\nNyquist also supports multiple maps for multi-site campuses. Each \nsite can define its own map objects and restrict calls and paging to its \nown administrator. \nMaps can have an unlimited number of levels, so, for example, an \noffice administrator could navigate to a building, a specific floor in \nthe building, and a specific room on the selected floor. For locations \nthat are frequently called or paged, a defined action object can be \nplaced as a button on a top level or sub level view so that navigating \nthrough multiple levels of maps is not required to initiate a call or \npage.",

For example, suppose you have layers of maps \nthat include the buildings and each floor in a building, but you most \nfrequently call one or two extensions. Rather than drilling down mul-\ntiple maps or objects each time you call an extension, you can create \na defined action object that is associated with that extension. The \nselectable object can be named for the extension and placed on the \nfirst level graphic. \nAnother reason for creating a defined action object that serves as a \nbutton would be if your Nyquist system server is managing multiple \nsites on a single campus.

The \nselectable object can be named for the extension and placed on the \nfirst level graphic. \nAnother reason for creating a defined action object that serves as a \nbutton would be if your Nyquist system server is managing multiple \nsites on a single campus.

If you delete a routine and then \nrecreate it, you may need to assign a new DTMF Code if the previous \ncode was assigned to another routine.\nTo delete a routine:\nStep 1\nOn the navigation bar, select Routines.\nStep 2\nOn the Routines page, select the Delete icon next to \nthe routine that you want to delete.\nStep 3\nWhen prompted, select Delete.\n13.8\nCreating and Executing Multi-Site Routines\nYou can create a routine to be launched on one or more remote sites, \nsuch as a lockdown routine to be launched at all sites in a district.\nTo create such a routine, you would select the Routine action Type \n(see \"Actions\u201d on page 402 and \"Understanding Action Parameters\u201d on \npage 406). You can select to execute the action on the local facility, a \nspecific facility, or all facility. If you want to execute the routine or \nmultiple, but not all, facilities, you must create a separate action for \neach facility (using Routine action Type).\nWhen you select a specific facility, you can enter the DTMF code of \nthe routine. A routine with that DTMF code must exist on that facility.\nRoutines that are triggered by another site will not execute calling or \npaging type actions. Also, the receiving facility must have Use Caller \nExtension disabled.\nNote: There will be a one-second delay between execution of one \nRoutine action and another Routine action. So, if you execute a \nmulti-site routine for 10 sites, there will be 10-second delay \nbetween when the routine starts on the first facility and when it \nstarts on the tenth facility. To eliminate this delay, you can select \nAll Facilities and then ensure that a routine with the specified \nDTMF does not exist on the sites that you do not want to run the \nroutine. If All Facilities is selected, the remote routines start at the \nsame time.\n390\n13.8.1\nCall Detail Records\nCall Detail Records (CDRs) are created when a routine is started. \nWhen started on a local facility, the Destination field will show Local \nFacility and the Type field will show Start Routine (<routine-\nDTMF-code>).\nWhen a routine is started on a selected remote facility, the CDR will \nshow the remote facility name in the Destination field and Start \nRemote Routine (<routine-DTMF-code>) in the Type field.\nWhen a routine is started on all facilities, the CDR will show All Facil-\nities in the Destination field and Start Remote Routine (<routine-\nDTMF-code>) in the Type field.\nFor more information about view CDRs, see \"Viewing Call Detail \nRecords\u201d on page 319.\n13.9\nAllowing Input Contact Closure to Initiate \nRing-Tone to Speakers\nThrough the Routines feature, you can let an input contact closure \ninitiate the playing of a ringtone to designated stations. \nTo do this, create a routine (see \"Adding a Routine\u201d on page 387) that \nuses Play-Ringtone as the action Type (see \"Understanding Action \nParameters\u201d on page 406). For the Action, select Start. Select the \nZones that contain the speakers you want to play the ringtone.\nTo stop the ringtone, create a second routine that is triggered when \nthe contact opens and uses the Stop for the Action.\n13.10\nUsing Triggers\nA trigger is an event that starts a routine. By default, when you create \na routine, it has no trigger or actions.\nA trigger can have up to two parameters. For example, you can create \na trigger that uses a specific Announcement. The first parameter \nwould be the Announcement Type (Number) and the second \nparameter would be the Announcement.",

Each of \nthese action types depend on the status of the Callers \u2013 parameter 1 \nfor the trigger (see \"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d on page 395).\nThe Check-Intercom action Type checks to see if the trigger caller is \non an active intercom call.

If the trigger caller is \nnot on an active intercom call, the routine terminates and remaining \nactions will not be executed. You may want a routine to execute a \nCheck-Intercom action Type before executing Intercom-Wait to \nensure that the trigger caller is on an active intercom call.\nThe Intercom-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller\u2019s call to \nfinish.

In this scenario, you would want to \nensure that the action to play an announcement waits until the alarm \nends. \n13.11.7.1 Check-Intercom, Intercom-Wait, Ring-Wait Action \nTypes\nIf a routine\u2019s trigger Type is Intercom-Call, the routine\u2019s action Type \ncould be Check-Intercom, Intercom-Wait, or Ring-Wait. Each of \nthese action types depend on the status of the Callers \u2013 parameter 1 \nfor the trigger (see \"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d on page 395).\nThe Check-Intercom action Type checks to see if the trigger caller is \non an active intercom call. If the trigger caller is on an active intercom \ncall, the routine executes subsequent actions. If the trigger caller is \nnot on an active intercom call, the routine terminates and remaining \nactions will not be executed. You may want a routine to execute a \nCheck-Intercom action Type before executing Intercom-Wait to \nensure that the trigger caller is on an active intercom call.\nThe Intercom-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller\u2019s call to \nfinish. After the call finishes, the routine executes subsequent actions. \nIf the call finishes before Intercom-Wait action Type is executed, the \nroutine executes subsequent actions without delay.\nThe Ring-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller\u2019s ringing to \nfinish. After the ringing stage of a call ends, the routine executes sub-\nsequent actions. If the call is answered before the Ring-Wait action \nType executes, the routine executes subsequent actions without \ndelay.\nA sample scenario using these three actions is a routine that is exe-\ncuted by the Intercom-Call trigger Type. The routine contains actions \nto be performed to indicate a ringing call The routine waits for the \nring to finish (Ring-Wait action Type). When the ring finishes, the rou-\ntine executes additional actions and then checks to see if the call was \nanswered (Check-Intercom action Type). If the call was not answered \n(no active intercom call), the routine terminates. Otherwise, it exe-\ncutes additional actions before waiting for the call to finish (Inter-\ncom-Wait action Type), and then when the call is finished, the routine \nexecutes the remaining actions.\n421\n13.11.7.2 Check-In Action Type with Check In Set to Wait\nWhen the routine includes a Check-In action Type and Check-In \n(parameter 1) is Wait, the routine pauses the execution of subse-\nquent actions until the Check-in process is no longer active. When \nthe Check-In process is Finished or you select Stop, Finish, or Reset, \nthe routine resumes executing actions that follow a finished Check-In \nprocess such as: announcing Check-In completed to Admin Station \nspeakers or displaying Check-in completion messages on web inter-\nface dashboards or GA10PV displays. \nCheck-In action Type with Check-In set to Wait does not differenti-\nate between the Check-in process moving to the Finished state or \nhaving been manually stopped or finished.\nFor more information about the Check-In process, see \"Manage \nCheck-In\u201d on page 409.\n13.11.7.3 Feature-Wait Action Type with 911\nYou may want to include the Feature-Wait action Type in a routine \nthat is triggered by a 911 call to pause subsequent actions until the \n911 call ends. In this scenario, set Feature Wait (parameter 1 of the \nFeature-Wait action Type) to 911.\nAfter the 911 call ends, the routine executes subsequent actions.

The routine \nsettings for Extension and Use Caller's Extension are not related \nto these wait actions; the check and wait actions will always be \nevaluated based on the trigger caller regardless of the routine's \nExtension or User Caller's Extension settings.\nNote: If you want to execute routine Actions after all stations have \nchecked in (Check-In status is Done), create a routine with trigger \nType set to Check-In and Parameter 1 set to Done.\n422\n13.11.7.4 Feature-Wait Action Type with Alarm\nIf you want to pause subsequent routine actions until the alarm fin-\nishes playing, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait \n(parameter 1) set to Alarm. If no alarm is playing when the Feature \nWait action executes, the routine does not wait for an alarm. Instead, \nit continues executing subsequent actions.\nIf you want to ensure that the routine includes an active alarm, use \nAlarm as the trigger Type (see \"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d \non page 395).\nIf you do not need the routine to wait until the alarm finishes, you can \nstill use Feature-Wait as the action Type and Alarm as Feature Wait \nand set Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) to the desired \namount of time to wait.\n13.11.7.5 Feature-Wait Action Type with Announcement\nIf you want all active Normal and Emergency announcements to \ncomplete before continue with subsequent routine actions, use the \nFeature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (parameter 1) set to \nAnnouncement.\nThis action will not allow you to specify which announcement type or \nwhich announcement to wait for. The Announcement trigger Type \ndoes allow you to specify an announcement type or number (see \n\"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d on page 395). However, if the \nroutine uses Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait set to \nAnnouncement and multiple announcements start, then the routine \nwill pause until all announcements have completed.\n13.11.7.6 Feature-Wait Action Type with All-Call\nIf you want a routine to pause until an active All-Call page completes, \nuse the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (parameter 1) \nset to All-Call.\nIf no All-Call page is playing when the Feature Wait action executes, \nthe routine does not wait for an All-Call page. Instead, it continues \nexecuting subsequent actions.\nIf you want to ensure that the routine includes an All-Call page, use \nAll-Call as the trigger Type.\nIf you do not need the routine to wait until the All-Call page finishes, \nyou can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and All-Call as",

Stations can still \nplace Urgent or Emergency calls during the Check-in process, even if \nthe station has not checked in. \nIf audio prompt feedback is enabled and a station checks in, the \ncaller hears a confirmation prompt. If audio feedback is disabled, sta-\ntions checking in with digital call switches will still see a ringing status \n(flashing green) for about 2 seconds while checking in. Stations \nchecking in with IP phones will notice a call lasting about 2 seconds \nbefore automatic hang up.\nA VoIP Speaker Only station that does not have a call switch can still \nparticipate in the check-in process if an I/O controller Input contact is \nconnected to a switch present in the room that contains the VoIP \nSpeaker Only station. In this case, the I/O controller Input contact \nclosure can trigger a Routine that performs a check-in.\nIn this scenario, the routine Trigger Type is set to Input-Contact-\nClosed (see \"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d on page 395) and \nthe routine Action Type is Check-In with Station set to the VoIP \nSpeaker Only station extension (see \"Understanding Action Parame-\nters\u201d on page 406).\nIf a station with call switch is configured to only place Urgent or \nEmergency calls, the station cannot participate in the Check-in pro-\ncess. This station should either be added to the Exclusion List (see \n\"Managing Exclusion and Vacancy Lists\u201d on page 454). Or if you wish \nto include the station in the Check-in process, the station\u2019s CoS con-\nfiguration should be changed to allow Normal calls to be placed by \nthe station (see \"Editing CoS Parameters for a Station\u201d on page 66). \n15.1.1.2 Check-In Done and Finish\nAfter all stations included in the Check-In process have checked in, \nthe Manage Check-In Status changes to Done. \nSince stations that were not expected to check in may do so, check-in \nis not completed until you select the Finish button.\nSelecting the Finish button can trigger a routine if you have a routine \nthat uses Check-In as the trigger Type and Finished as Check-In. \n(See \"Understanding Trigger Parameters\u201d on page 395 for more infor-\nmation.)\n452\n15.1.2\nStopping the Check-In Process\nYou can end an active Check-In process by selecting the Stop button \non the Station Check-in view.

For example, a fire drill could use audio explaining \nthat it was a drill and would not include an actual 911 call where a \nroutine used for evacuating during an actual fire could include a 911 \ncall. In this scenario, the word \u201cdrill\u201d should appear in the name.\nIf you want to create routines for accurate exclusion and vacancy lists, \nuse descriptive names such as \u201cFire Drill Period 1.\u201d Each routine \nshould include a Check-In action Type that uses Vacancy-Add and a \nseparate Check-In action Type that uses Vacancy-Delete. \n458\n15.4\nCheck-In Log and Call Detail Records\nManage Check-In writes data to a log file (see \"Using System Log \nFiles\u201d on page 315) and creates a Call Detail Record (see \"Viewing Call \nDetail Records\u201d on page 319). You can export and print the check-in \nlog file using the Export button (see \"Exporting a Log File\u201d on \npage 318). You can also copy the displayed log file information and \npaste it into another application.\nEach logged event starts with a date and time stamp, followed by the \nstation extension that created the event, and ending with optional \nevent related information.

The resulting message will per-\nhaps be more difficult to read than the original. Use this option if \nNote: The font size will automatically resize to 20 if the Alert mes-\nsage has these following parameters:\n\u2022 Priority is smaller than 6.\n\u2022 Text length is longer than 1500 characters.\n\u2022 The text has more than 500 capital letter characters.\nThe font size also automatically resizes to 20 if needed, even if the \n$auto_resize variable is not specified.\nNote: This option is not recommended if the server\u2019s physical \nlocation is in a different county from your facility, if your server \nresides in the cloud, or if you are tracking alerts for multiple facili-\nties and those facilities are not in the same county. Instead, find \nand use your county code.\n467\nyou want to ensure that messages will fit on the screen. You may \nneed to experiment to determine a suitable value for <Integer>. \nYou can combine this option with the $auto_resize variable.\n\u2022 <County-Code>. Displays weather alerts for the specified county. \nFor example, the county code for Orange County, Florida, is \nFLC095.  \n\u2022 INCLUDE_CODES. Displays, the Severity, Certainty, Urgency and \nResponse codes on the Alerts header for each alert displayed on \nthe NQ-GA10PV display (see Figure 16-2, \u201cSample Alert With Ele-\nments Defined,\u201d on page 464).\n\u2022 INCLUDE_COUNTY. Displays the county code on the Alerts head-\ners. This is useful if you have several Alert related routines that use \ndifferent county codes.\n\u2022 INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS. Displays instructions that came with \nthe weather alerts. If you want to display the exact instructions \nprovided by the NWS, then add the INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS \noption. Instructions are usually obvious (like seek shelter, stay \nindoors, stay hydrated). However, instructions can be verbose and, \nwhile they can provide valuable information, verbose instructions \ncould cause the messages to be too large to display properly.\nNote: Font sizes are set in the Display Message options (see \"Cre-\nating a Display Message\u201d on page 438). For weather alerts, the fol-\nlowing settings are recommended for the Liberation Sans font:\n\u2022 30 - When not using the AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer> option \nof the $alerts variable and not using the $auto_resize variable. A \nfont size of 30 will ensure that the actual lines from the NWS \nwill fit on each line displayed.\n\u2022 65 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_15 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 40 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_25 and $auto_resize(25) \nvariable.\n\u2022 70 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_<Inter> and $auto_resize \nvariable with display message priority of 6.\nNote: County codes are available at: https://alerts-v2.weather.gov/\ncounties.\n468\n\u2022 REPEAT_<Integer>. Automatically repeats the alert processing \nand re-displays any resulting alerts every <Integer> seconds. Pre-\nvious alerts are automatically removed from displays. This option \nprovides a convenient way to check for and display alerts at a reg-\nular interval without having to create a routine loop and without \nhaving to worry about deleting previous or expired alerts. When \nthis option is used, no subsequent actions will be executed in the \nRoutine that executes the Display-Msg action. Since alert pro-\ncessing requires Internet access processing, Bogen recommends a \nminimum <Integer> value of 60 seconds. Using less than 60 sec-\nonds may significantly impact your network and Nyquist server \nprocessing utilization.\n\u2022 UPDATE_CACHE. Nyquist caches the found county code so the \nsystem does not have to search more than one time. \nIf your county code changes, you can include the option \nUPDATE_CACHE along with AUTO_FIND_COUNTY to have the \nsystem discover the county code and cache the new value. \nNote: You should delete the UPDATE_CACHE option after use; \notherwise, the Nyquist system searches for the county code each \ntime alerts are retrieved.\n469\nA sample alert string is:\n$alerts(FLC095,INCLUDE_CODES,AUTO_COMPRESS_15,REPEAT_60) \nThis string will display alerts for county code FLC095 (Orange County, \nFlorida) every 60 seconds including the Severity, Certainty, Urgency, \nand Repose codes, while automatically compressing alerts that have \nmore than 15 lines.\n16.4\nDemonstration Alerts\nSeveral demonstration, or sample, Alerts are available for display. \nThese samples represent typical alerts sent by the NWS for various \nalert types.\nYou can access these by replacing the <County-Code> with \nALERT_DEMO<number> where <number> is replaced with a number \nbetween 1 and 20 (for example, ALERT_DEMO10). Bogen recom-\nmends that you try each demonstration alert to get familiar with the \nalert format, the available $alerts options, and the font sizing.\nFigure 16-3, How Parameters Affect Display",
