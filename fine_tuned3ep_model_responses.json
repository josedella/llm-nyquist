        "response": "The issue is likely due to a configuration setting within the Bogen E7000 system that is causing the emergency buttons to enter a dormant state after a specified period of inactivity. This setting may be related to the system's auto-power-down feature, which is designed to conserve power during periods of low usage.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can disable the auto-power-down feature or adjust the inactivity timer setting within the system configuration to prevent the emergency buttons from entering a dormant state. Additionally, ensure that the network switch is configured to allow for multiple active ports to prevent power cycling from affecting other connected devices.\n\nIt is important"
