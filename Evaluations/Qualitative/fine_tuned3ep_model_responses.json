While it is possible to configure each station individually, there is an easier way to do so on the Bridge or server level.\n\nTo deploy the admin group across all stations in the main office, you can create a bridge station that serves as the admin bridge. This bridge station can be assigned to the admin group, allowing the admin phones to participate in the admin functionality without having to configure each station separately.\n\nTo create the admin bridge station, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: On the Bridge Devices page, select the Add icon to create a new bridge device."
