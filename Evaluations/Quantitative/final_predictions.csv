Viewing Events for a Schedule
An event is the scheduled sounding of a tone or the playing of 
Scheduled Audio. You add events to a schedule. For example, you 
can schedule a tone to sound at 8 am as an event such as the start of 
a shift. You can add a second event that has the tone sound at 10 am 
for a scheduled break.
To review events for a schedule:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, expand Schedules.

associations that the Admin Station has (for example, member of Day 
Admin, Night Admin, Night Ring, or Admin Group). 
After you delete a second station from an SPA112, the Nyquist 
system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist system server does 
not know the SPA112's IP Address, you must reboot the SPA112 
device for the changes to take effect on the SPA112. 
When a station is deleted from an SPA112, it can take several minutes 
for the changes to show up on the SPA112's web interface. When the 
second station is deleted from the SPA112, the remaining station is 
set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station was previously 
set up on the second port (Phone 2). If this situation occurs, move the 
attached phone cable from Phone 2 to Phone 1.
To delete a station’s configurations:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
Select the Delete icon for the station that you want to 
delete configuration settings.
Step 3
When prompted, select Delete.
3.4
Adding a Station
Using the Nyquist system server’s automatic discovery feature is the 
preferred method of adding a station. If you manually add a station, 
you risk having the MAC address entered incorrectly, which would 
prevent the station from functioning properly.
If the station Type is Admin Web Interface, Admin Phone, IP Phone, 
Analog Phone, or Mobile Device, you can set a default Announce-
ment Zone and the Announcement Zone Configuration Type. If 
the Announcement Zone Configuration Type is set to Fixed, the 
zone used to play announcements will always be the zone number 
provided for Announcement Zone and cannot be changed. If set to 
Default, the Announcement Zone value is used as the default zone, 
but you can set an announcement to play to another zone.
To view and add discovered stations:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
On the Stations page, select New Stations.

Using a Cisco SPA112 Adapter
The Cisco SPA112 is an Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) that allows 
an analog phone to access IP phone services through two standard 
telephone RJ-11 phone ports.
The following limitations exist when the Cisco SPA112 is used as a 
Nyquist Admin Phone station:
• Call queuing is not supported.
• Call waiting is limited to one call. If the Admin Phone is associated 
with an Admin Group, a call made to the Admin Phone when the 
phone is already on a call will automatically ring the Admin Group. 
If the Admin Phone is not associated with an Admin Group and","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

associations that the Admin Station has (for example, member of Day 
Admin, Night Admin, Night Ring, or Admin Group). 
After you delete a second station from an SPA112, the Nyquist 
system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist system server does 
not know the SPA112's IP Address, you must reboot the SPA112 
device for the changes to take effect on the SPA112. 
When a station is deleted from an SPA112, it can take several minutes 
for the changes to show up on the SPA112's web interface. When the 
second station is deleted from the SPA112, the remaining station is 
set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station was previously 
set up on the second port (Phone 2). If this situation occurs, move the 
attached phone cable from Phone 2 to Phone 1.
To delete a station’s configurations:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
Select the Delete icon for the station that you want to 
delete configuration settings.
Step 3
When prompted, select Delete.
3.4
Adding a Station
Using the Nyquist system server’s automatic discovery feature is the 
preferred method of adding a station. If you manually add a station, 
you risk having the MAC address entered incorrectly, which would 
prevent the station from functioning properly.
If the station Type is Admin Web Interface, Admin Phone, IP Phone, 
Analog Phone, or Mobile Device, you can set a default Announce-
ment Zone and the Announcement Zone Configuration Type. If 
the Announcement Zone Configuration Type is set to Fixed, the 
zone used to play announcements will always be the zone number 
provided for Announcement Zone and cannot be changed. If set to 
Default, the Announcement Zone value is used as the default zone, 
but you can set an announcement to play to another zone.
To view and add discovered stations:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
On the Stations page, select New Stations.

Step 3
From the New Stations page, select the Add icon next 
to the station that you want to configure.
Step 4
Complete the options that are not automatically filled. 
(See ""Station Configuration Page Parameters” on 
page 107.)
Step 5
Select Save.
To manually add a station:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
Select the Add icon.
Step 3
Complete the configuration parameters for the new 
station. Parameters are described in ""Station Configura-
tion Page Parameters” on page 107.
Step 4
Select Save.
3.4.1
Swapping a Nyquist Device
Through the New Stations option, you can replace an existing device 
with a new device. This option allows you to replace a device, such as 
VoIP speaker, with a new device of the same type and maintain the 
original device’s extension and configuration.
You can also use the New Stations option to replace an audio power 
amplifier with another amplifier, regardless of type. For example, you 
can replace an NQ-A2060 amplifier with an NQ-A2300 amplifier.

Managing Bridge Devices
Bridge Devices, such as the NQ-E7030 Analog Station Bridge (ASB), 
allow the E7000 solution to use the existing analog call switches, 25 
volt speakers, analog phones, and existing infrastructure when 
upgrading from Multicom 2000, Quantum Multicom IP, and sup-
ported third-party intercom systems. When used exclusively as a net-
worked component of the E7000 series paging and intercom 
solution, the ASB permits a hybrid IP/analog system configuration 
through use or connection of analog 25V speakers and associated 
analog call switches (for example, CA-15C type). 
The ASB has 24 station connections that attach to hardwired 25 volt 
speakers and their associated call switches. While each connection 
has its own SIP addressable Station ID, the ASB itself uses a single 
network IP address.

Call Detail Records
Call Detail Records (CDRs) are created when a routine is started. 
When started on a local facility, the Destination field will show Local 
Facility and the Type field will show Start Routine (<routine-
DTMF-code>).
When a routine is started on a selected remote facility, the CDR will 
show the remote facility name in the Destination field and Start 
Remote Routine (<routine-DTMF-code>) in the Type field.
When a routine is started on all facilities, the CDR will show All Facil-
ities in the Destination field and Start Remote Routine (<routine-
DTMF-code>) in the Type field.
For more information about view CDRs, see ""Viewing Call Detail 
Records” on page 319.

Allowing Input Contact Closure to Initiate 
Ring-Tone to Speakers
Through the Routines feature, you can let an input contact closure 
initiate the playing of a ringtone to designated stations. 
To do this, create a routine (see ""Adding a Routine” on page 387) that 
uses Play-Ringtone as the action Type (see ""Understanding Action 
Parameters” on page 406). For the Action, select Start. Select the 
Zones that contain the speakers you want to play the ringtone.
To stop the ringtone, create a second routine that is triggered when 
the contact opens and uses the Stop for the Action.
13.10
Using Triggers
A trigger is an event that starts a routine. By default, when you create 
a routine, it has no trigger or actions.
A trigger can have up to two parameters. For example, you can create 
a trigger that uses a specific Announcement. The first parameter 
would be the Announcement Type (Number) and the second 
parameter would be the Announcement.

What caution should be exercised when deleting a routine?,"3
389
13.7
Deleting a Routine
Use caution when deleting routines. If you delete a routine and then 
recreate it, you may need to assign a new DTMF Code if the previous 
code was assigned to another routine.
To delete a routine:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Routines.
Step 2
On the Routines page, select the Delete icon next to 
the routine that you want to delete.
Step 3
When prompted, select Delete.
13.8
Creating and Executing Multi-Site Routines
You can create a routine to be launched on one or more remote sites, 
such as a lockdown routine to be launched at all sites in a district.
To create such a routine, you would select the Routine action Type 
(see ""Actions” on page 402 and ""Understanding Action Parameters” on 
page 406). You can select to execute the action on the local facility, a 
specific facility, or all facility. If you want to execute the routine or 
multiple, but not all, facilities, you must create a separate action for 
each facility (using Routine action Type).
When you select a specific facility, you can enter the DTMF code of 
the routine. A routine with that DTMF code must exist on that facility.
Routines that are triggered by another site will not execute calling or 
paging type actions. Also, the receiving facility must have Use Caller 
Extension disabled.
Note: There will be a one-second delay between execution of one 
Routine action and another Routine action. So, if you execute a 
multi-site routine for 10 sites, there will be 10-second delay 
between when the routine starts on the first facility and when it 
starts on the tenth facility. To eliminate this delay, you can select 
All Facilities and then ensure that a routine with the specified 
DTMF does not exist on the sites that you do not want to run the 
routine. If All Facilities is selected, the remote routines start at the 
same time.
390
13.8.1
Call Detail Records
Call Detail Records (CDRs) are created when a routine is started. 
When started on a local facility, the Destination field will show Local 
Facility and the Type field will show Start Routine (<routine-
DTMF-code>).
When a routine is started on a selected remote facility, the CDR will 
show the remote facility name in the Destination field and Start 
Remote Routine (<routine-DTMF-code>) in the Type field.
When a routine is started on all facilities, the CDR will show All Facil-
ities in the Destination field and Start Remote Routine (<routine-
DTMF-code>) in the Type field.
For more information about view CDRs, see ""Viewing Call Detail 
Records” on page 319.
13.9
Allowing Input Contact Closure to Initiate 
Ring-Tone to Speakers
Through the Routines feature, you can let an input contact closure 
initiate the playing of a ringtone to designated stations. 
To do this, create a routine (see ""Adding a Routine” on page 387) that 
uses Play-Ringtone as the action Type (see ""Understanding Action 
Parameters” on page 406). For the Action, select Start. Select the 
Zones that contain the speakers you want to play the ringtone.
To stop the ringtone, create a second routine that is triggered when 
the contact opens and uses the Stop for the Action.
13.10
Using Triggers
A trigger is an event that starts a routine. By default, when you create 
a routine, it has no trigger or actions.
A trigger can have up to two parameters. For example, you can create 
a trigger that uses a specific Announcement. The first parameter 
would be the Announcement Type (Number) and the second 
parameter would be the Announcement.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Tuning Volume with White or Pink Noise
Nyquist provides white noise and pink noise files to help tune, or 
adjust, the volume of speakers in a zone.
White noise has equal energy for each frequency that the human ear 
can hear. Pink noise sounds less harsh than white noise because 
humans hear in octaves (the doubling of a frequency band). The 
energy in pink noise decreases by half as the frequency doubles, 
making the noise sound more balanced.
Both white and pink noise files are provided by default in Nyquist as 
both tones and songs. You can use the tone files as a tone generator 
to help adjust volume and frequency for pages in time-based zones. 
You can use the song files to help adjust volume and frequency in 
audio zones that play audio distribution.
Remember that when creating, editing, or viewing a zone, the Type 
identifies the zone as being able to receive paging, time, audio, or a 
combination of paging, time, or audio. (See ""Viewing Zone Informa-
tion” on page 168.)
To launch a white noise or pink noise file as a tone, follow the steps 
listed in ""Managing Tones Via the Dashboard” on page 346, selecting 
either the White Noise or Pink Noise file.
To play a white noise or pink noise file to a zone that plays audio dis-
tribution, first create a playlist that contains the white or pink noise 
song (see ""Creating a Playlist” on page 259) and then follow the steps 
listed in ""Using Audio Distribution” on page 353 to launch the audio 
distribution. 
If the zone can receive a combination of paging, time, and audio, you 
should use both the tone files and the song files to tune the speaker 
volume.

2.3.6
Registering as a Third-Party SIP Endpoint
You can configure a Nyquist SIP trunk to register with a third-party 
SIP endpoint with an IP-PBX. This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX 
defined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.
The steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-
point for an IP-PBX are:
1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-
tem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-
point as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone 
with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the 
SIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk 
must use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the 
Add SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a 
DISA station. 
When an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-
ing call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-
sion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the 
Nyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to 
initiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX

SIP Trunk Custom Configuration Settings
The Custom Settings parameter can be used if additional parame-
ters are needed during SIP trunk configuration to satisfy SIP trunk 
provider requirements. Bogen Technical Support will provide any 
necessary custom settings. In most cases, Custom Settings are not 
required.
Custom Settings can be entered when adding or editing SIP Trunk 
parameters (see ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration Parameters” on 
page 72 or ""Editing a SIP Trunk Configuration” on page 81) using the 
following format:
:TABLE-NAME:<variable>=<value>:TABLE-NAME:
In this format, TABLE-NAME is one of the following:
• ENDPOINT
• AOR
• AUTH
• SIPTRUNK
Variable is a valid variable from one of the pjsip tables (ps_endpoints, 
ps_aors, ps_auths) or sip_trunk table.
DID
Enter the 10-digit DID telephone number that the SIP trunk 
or hosted VoIP provider has assigned the SIP trunk, using 
the format NPANXXxxxx (that is, no spaces or dashes).

Registering as a Third-Party SIP Endpoint
You can configure a Nyquist SIP trunk to register with a third-party 
SIP endpoint with an IP-PBX. This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX 
defined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.
The steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-
point for an IP-PBX are:
1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-
tem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-
point as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone 
with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the 
SIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk 
must use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the 
Add SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a 
DISA station. 
When an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-
ing call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-
sion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the 
Nyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to 
initiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX 
Note: The station extension used for the DISA Line must be differ-
ent than the extension being used by your IP-PBX.

Manage Check-In
Manage Check-In allows you to quickly obtain status of specific areas 
– such as classrooms, offices, or breakrooms – within a facility during 
a check-in event. Examples of check-in events include:
• Weather related shelter in place
• Safety related lockdown
• Fire evacuation (Teacher performs check-in to indicate room has 
been evacuated.)
• Room occupancy (Teacher checks room in with start of each class 
period.)
During a check-in event, users check in by initiating a Normal call to 
their assigned Admin Station, such as the front office, using either 
their Nyquist phone or a digital or analog call switch associated with 
their intercom speaker or station.
During Check-In, a Normal call initiated by a station to the Admin 
Station places a station in checked-in status. Additional Normal calls 
made following a check-in are processed as Normal calls to the 
Admin Station.
You can also elect to enable audio feedback that tells the staff 
member they have successfully checked in.
Calls made as part of the Manage Check-In process are not applied 
towards the system’s Current Call Count. Urgent and Emergency calls 
can still be placed by stations and are not included as part of Manage 
Check-In. 
As long as Privacy Mode is not enabled and a room’s device allows 
two-way transmission, you can select to use Spy Mode to listen to 
the room.

If a routine’s trigger Type is Intercom-Call, the routine’s action Type 
could be Check-Intercom, Intercom-Wait, or Ring-Wait. Each of 
these action types depend on the status of the Callers – parameter 1 
for the trigger (see ""Understanding Trigger Parameters” on page 395).
The Check-Intercom action Type checks to see if the trigger caller is 
on an active intercom call. If the trigger caller is on an active intercom 
call, the routine executes subsequent actions. If the trigger caller is 
not on an active intercom call, the routine terminates and remaining 
actions will not be executed. You may want a routine to execute a 
Check-Intercom action Type before executing Intercom-Wait to 
ensure that the trigger caller is on an active intercom call.
The Intercom-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller’s call to 
finish. After the call finishes, the routine executes subsequent actions. 
If the call finishes before Intercom-Wait action Type is executed, the 
routine executes subsequent actions without delay.
The Ring-Wait action Type waits for the trigger caller’s ringing to 
finish. After the ringing stage of a call ends, the routine executes sub-
sequent actions. If the call is answered before the Ring-Wait action 
Type executes, the routine executes subsequent actions without 
delay.
A sample scenario using these three actions is a routine that is exe-
cuted by the Intercom-Call trigger Type. The routine contains actions

Setting Variables for the Display Message
You can use the following variables in the Text field of a Display-
Msg to have NWS alerts automatically appear on the video display 
connected to the NQ-GA10PV:
• $alerts
• $auto_resize
The $auto_resize variable must be immediately followed by a number 
in parentheses, for example, $auto_resize(20). In this example, 
Nyquist automatically resizes the display message by decreasing the 
font size if needed to better fit the message to the screen but will 
keep the font size to at least 20. 
The $alerts variable is also immediately followed by parameters in 
parentheses. The available parameters are:
• AUTO_FIND_COUNTY. Automatically discovers the county code 
associated with the Nyquist server’s public IP address. 
• AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer>. Automatically compresses the 
display message if the number of lines in the message exceeds the 
<Integer> value. For example, AUTO_COMPRESS_15 will cause 
messages that contain more than 15 lines to be compressed by 
removing end-of-line characters (lines will run together, separated 
by a space instead of end-of-line). The resulting message will per-
haps be more difficult to read than the original. Use this option if 
Note: The font size will automatically resize to 20 if the Alert mes-
sage has these following parameters:
• Priority is smaller than 6.
• Text length is longer than 1500 characters.
• The text has more than 500 capital letter characters.
The font size also automatically resizes to 20 if needed, even if the 
$auto_resize variable is not specified.
Note: This option is not recommended if the server’s physical 
location is in a different county from your facility, if your server 
resides in the cloud, or if you are tracking alerts for multiple facili-
ties and those facilities are not in the same county. Instead, find 
and use your county code.
467
you want to ensure that messages will fit on the screen. You may 
need to experiment to determine a suitable value for <Integer>. 
You can combine this option with the $auto_resize variable.
• <County-Code>. Displays weather alerts for the specified county. 
For example, the county code for Orange County, Florida, is 
FLC095.  
• INCLUDE_CODES. Displays, the Severity, Certainty, Urgency and 
Response codes on the Alerts header for each alert displayed on 
the NQ-GA10PV display (see Figure 16-2, “Sample Alert With Ele-
ments Defined,” on page 464).
• INCLUDE_COUNTY. Displays the county code on the Alerts head-
ers. This is useful if you have several Alert related routines that use 
different county codes.
• INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS. Displays instructions that came with 
the weather alerts. If you want to display the exact instructions 
provided by the NWS, then add the INCLUDE_INSTRUCTIONS 
option. Instructions are usually obvious (like seek shelter, stay 
indoors, stay hydrated). However, instructions can be verbose and, 
while they can provide valuable information, verbose instructions 
could cause the messages to be too large to display properly.
Note: Font sizes are set in the Display Message options (see ""Cre-
ating a Display Message” on page 438). For weather alerts, the fol-
lowing settings are recommended for the Liberation Sans font:
• 30 - When not using the AUTO_COMPRESS_<Integer> option 
of the $alerts variable and not using the $auto_resize variable. A 
font size of 30 will ensure that the actual lines from the NWS 
will fit on each line displayed.
• 65 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_15 and $auto_resize(25) 
variable.
• 40 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_25 and $auto_resize(25) 
variable.
• 70 - When using AUTO_COMPRESS_<Inter> and $auto_resize 
variable with display message priority of 6.
Note: County codes are available at: https://alerts-v2.weather.gov/
counties.
468
• REPEAT_<Integer>. Automatically repeats the alert processing 
and re-displays any resulting alerts every <Integer> seconds. Pre-
vious alerts are automatically removed from displays. This option 
provides a convenient way to check for and display alerts at a reg-
ular interval without having to create a routine loop and without 
having to worry about deleting previous or expired alerts. When 
this option is used, no subsequent actions will be executed in the 
Routine that executes the Display-Msg action. Since alert pro-
cessing requires Internet access processing, Bogen recommends a 
minimum <Integer> value of 60 seconds. Using less than 60 sec-
onds may significantly impact your network and Nyquist server 
processing utilization.
• UPDATE_CACHE. Nyquist caches the found county code so the 
system does not have to search more than one time. 
If your county code changes, you can include the option 
UPDATE_CACHE along with AUTO_FIND_COUNTY to have the 
system discover the county code and cache the new value. 
Note: You should delete the UPDATE_CACHE option after use; 
otherwise, the Nyquist system searches for the county code each 
time alerts are retrieved.
469
A sample alert string is:
$alerts(FLC095,INCLUDE_CODES,AUTO_COMPRESS_15,REPEAT_60) 
This string will display alerts for county code FLC095 (Orange County, 
Florida) every 60 seconds including the Severity, Certainty, Urgency, 
and Repose codes, while automatically compressing alerts that have 
more than 15 lines.
16.4
Demonstration Alerts
Several demonstration, or sample, Alerts are available for display. 
These samples represent typical alerts sent by the NWS for various 
alert types.
You can access these by replacing the <County-Code> with 
ALERT_DEMO<number> where <number> is replaced with a number 
between 1 and 20 (for example, ALERT_DEMO10). Bogen recom-
mends that you try each demonstration alert to get familiar with the 
alert format, the available $alerts options, and the font sizing.

Demonstration Alerts
Several demonstration, or sample, Alerts are available for display. 
These samples represent typical alerts sent by the NWS for various 
alert types.
You can access these by replacing the <County-Code> with 
ALERT_DEMO<number> where <number> is replaced with a number 
between 1 and 20 (for example, ALERT_DEMO10). Bogen recom-
mends that you try each demonstration alert to get familiar with the 
alert format, the available $alerts options, and the font sizing.

What is the benefit of using Internet Radio Services in conjunction with Nyquist’s audio management features?,"9 Managing Audio
247
Managing Audio
With Nyquist’s audio file management feature, you can:
• Specify an audio program for distribution to stations or zones.
• Record and play tones and announcements to stations or zones.
• Manage recordings of telephone calls made to and from stations.
Audio programs for distribution to stations or zones can include line-
input from the MMPA, Nyquist 2-channel or 4-channel amplifiers, 
user supplied songs or playlists, and Internet Radio Services. The 
Audio Distribution, tones, and announcement files added through 
the audio file management feature can be set through the Schedules 
feature to automatically play during specified times. (See ""Managing 
Schedules” on page 217.) Through the Internet Radio Services, you 
can listen to live radio stations and add media catalogs and music 
services without updating devices or software. 
Default tone and song files include white noise and pink noise that 
allows you to tune paging and audio distribution volumes. 
Note: Before using the audio file management feature, make sure 
that stations and zones have been configured (see ""Managing Sta-
tions, Zones, and Queues” on page 105) and that the station you are 
using to launch announcements, tones, or Audio Distribution has 
the appropriate CoS parameters set (see ""Using CoS Configuration” 
on page 63).

Audio Distribution
Suppose you want to use an audio source, such as a radio station 
accessed via the Internet, in a cafeteria but prevent that source from 
being played in a conference room. This feature, called Audio Distri-
bution, can be turned on by zone (an area or group of stations) or 
stations (group of devices such as VoIP speakers). You can add the 
speakers, or stations, in the cafeteria to a zone that allows Audio Dis-
tribution while the speakers in a conference room would not be 
placed into that zone.
Audio Distribution involves creating a playlist or selecting an input 
source and specifying which zones hear the playlist or input source. 
Through the Scheduled Audio feature, Audio Distribution can be tied 
to a specific event in a schedule (see ""Adding an Event” on page 227).

Using Variables in Dashboard and NQ-
GA10PV Identifiers
You can use the following variables in the Identifier field (Parameter 
2) of Display-Msg, Display-Msg-Delete, Dash-Text, and Dash-
Delete action types:
• $caller
• $called
• $station
• $contact
• $facility
• $eventid
• $eventname
• $zone
An Identifier can have a maximum character length of 255 charac-
ters. When using variables, be sure the names that will replace the 
$facility and $zone variables to not exceed this maximum character 
length.

Using Variables in Display-Msg Text
You can use the following variables in the Text field of only the Dis-
play-Msg action type:
• $calltypechar
• $calltypeshort
• $calltypelong
• $autobgcolor
• $autofontcolor
• $autopriority(E,U,N)
These variables allow you to set the priority and appearance of the 
NQ-GA10PV display messages for emergency, urgent, or intercom 
Note: This section describes variables that are only available for 
use in the Display-Msg action type if the routine trigger is Inter-
com-Call, Urgent-Call, or Emergency-Call.

Cloning an Action
If an action is used more than once in a routine, you might want to 
clone the action rather than create a new action. Cloning an action 
creates a duplicate of the selected action and places the duplicate at 
the end of the action list.
You can edit a cloned action if you want to change any of the param-
eters, such as duration.
To clone an action:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Routines.
Step 2
Select Actions for the routine that has the action you 
want to clone.
Step 3
Select the Clone button (
) for the action that you 
want to duplicate.
13.11.5
Understanding Action Parameters
An action can have up to four parameters, depending on the Type 
selected. 
When viewing actions, the parameters appear as Parameter 1, 
Parameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action 
page, though, the parameter names and available selections change 
based on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field 
called Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the 
tones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see ""Viewing Avail-
able Tones” on page 256). With this type of action, you can also set 
the Duration, which appears on the Actions page as Parameter 3. 
Parameters 2 and 4 are not used for this type of action, but you can 
set a Finish Delay, which establishes if the routine should wait until 
this action is completed before starting the next action.
Some actions have no parameters. For example, if you select All-Call 
for Type, no parameters are applicable.
The following table describes the action Type and any applicable 
parameters.

clone the action rather than create a new action. Cloning an action 
creates a duplicate of the selected action and places the duplicate at 
the end of the action list.
You can edit a cloned action if you want to change any of the param-
eters, such as duration.
To clone an action:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Routines.
Step 2
Select Actions for the routine that has the action you 
want to clone.
Step 3
Select the Clone button (
) for the action that you 
want to duplicate.
13.11.5
Understanding Action Parameters
An action can have up to four parameters, depending on the Type 
selected. 
When viewing actions, the parameters appear as Parameter 1, 
Parameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4. On the Edit Action 
page, though, the parameter names and available selections change 
based on the Type. For example, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field 
called Alarm appears with a drop-down menu that shows all of the 
tones with Type set to Alarm on the Tones page (see ""Viewing Avail-
able Tones” on page 256). With this type of action, you can also set 
the Duration, which appears on the Actions page as Parameter 3. 
Parameters 2 and 4 are not used for this type of action, but you can 
set a Finish Delay, which establishes if the routine should wait until 
this action is completed before starting the next action.
Some actions have no parameters. For example, if you select All-Call 
for Type, no parameters are applicable.
The following table describes the action Type and any applicable 
parameters.

Are there any limits on the number of zones or stations in a multicast zone?,"3 Managing Stations, 
Zones, and Queues
105
Managing Stations, Zones, and 
Queues
You can divide your facility into zones to control paging and audio 
activities or features. For example, suppose you want to allow the use 
of an audio source, such as a flash drive, in a cafeteria but prevent it 
from being played in a conference room. This feature, called audio 
distribution, can be turned on by zone, so the cafeteria could be 
placed in a zone that allows audio distribution while conference 
rooms would not be placed into that zone.
No limit exists for the number of zones or for the number of stations 
that can be in a multicast zone. Performance limits do exist for unicast 
connections. The station limit for your system is determined by your 
license (see ""NQ-E7000SSL – Nyquist E7000 System Station License” 
on page 486).
With the Page Queuing feature, you can record an unlimited number 
of pages or messages for queuing (stacking) for a specified zone or 
zones. A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may 
have multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before 
a queue can be created.
A station can be in multiple zones.
An E7000 station is: 
• A device used to access the web interface
• A speaker
• A phone 
• A Nyquist appliance
Note: For licensing purposes, an I/O Controller is not counted as a 
station.
106
To manage stations and zones, you first add stations and then create 
zones that contain more than one station. You can add stations by 
allowing the Nyquist server to automatically discover the device type, 
MAC address, IP address, and serial number, or manually add these 
and other parameters. For more information about adding a station, 
see ""Adding a Station” on page 153.

If you do not need the routine to wait until the Emergency-All-Call 
page finishes, you can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and 
Emerg-All-Call as Feature Wait and set Maximum Wait Time 
(action parameter 2) to the desired amount of time to wait.
13.11.7.9 Feature-Wait Action Type with Facility-Page
You can use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait 
(parameter 1) set to Facility-Page in a routine that is triggered by a 
facility page. The routine will pause subsequent actions until the facil-
ity page completes. If no facility page is playing when the Feature 
Wait action executes, the routine does not wait for a facility page. 
Instead, it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you do not need the routine to wait until the facility page finishes, 
you can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and Facility Page 
as Feature Wait and set Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) 
to the desired amount of time to wait.
Note: Only routines with the trigger Type set to Facility Page can 
use this action.
        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

","Setting the Maximum Wait Time during a Feature-Wait action specifies the maximum duration the routine will pause for the designated event (such as Disabling Audio, Emergency All-Call, or Facility Page) before proceeding to execute subsequent actions. If the specified event does not occur within that time frame, the routine continues execution regardless of whether the condition has been met.","According to the information, setting the Maximum Wait Time during a Feature-Wait action implies that the routine will wait for the specified amount of time if the feature (such as Emergency-All-Call or Facility-Page) is not available when the action executes.","Setting the Maximum Wait Time during a Feature-Wait action means that the routine will pause for the specified amount of time before continuing to execute subsequent actions. If the specified time expires before the feature is enabled or the page is completed, the routine will proceed regardless."

13.11.7.2 Check-In Action Type with Check In Set to Wait
When the routine includes a Check-In action Type and Check-In 
(parameter 1) is Wait, the routine pauses the execution of subse-
quent actions until the Check-in process is no longer active. When 
the Check-In process is Finished or you select Stop, Finish, or Reset, 
the routine resumes executing actions that follow a finished Check-In 
process such as: announcing Check-In completed to Admin Station 
speakers or displaying Check-in completion messages on web inter-
face dashboards or GA10PV displays. 
Check-In action Type with Check-In set to Wait does not differenti-
ate between the Check-in process moving to the Finished state or 
having been manually stopped or finished.
For more information about the Check-In process, see ""Manage 
Check-In” on page 409.
13.11.7.3 Feature-Wait Action Type with 911
You may want to include the Feature-Wait action Type in a routine 
that is triggered by a 911 call to pause subsequent actions until the 
911 call ends. In this scenario, set Feature Wait (parameter 1 of the 
Feature-Wait action Type) to 911.
After the 911 call ends, the routine executes subsequent actions. The 
911 trigger Type can execute routines when any caller dials 911, so 
multiple routines (one for each active 911 call) could execute.
Note: The check and wait actions described in this section are 
always related to the caller that triggered the routine. The routine 
settings for Extension and Use Caller's Extension are not related 
to these wait actions; the check and wait actions will always be 
evaluated based on the trigger caller regardless of the routine's 
Extension or User Caller's Extension settings.
Note: If you want to execute routine Actions after all stations have 
checked in (Check-In status is Done), create a routine with trigger 
Type set to Check-In and Parameter 1 set to Done.

13.11.7.4 Feature-Wait Action Type with Alarm
If you want to pause subsequent routine actions until the alarm fin-
ishes playing, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait 
(parameter 1) set to Alarm. If no alarm is playing when the Feature 
Wait action executes, the routine does not wait for an alarm. Instead, 
it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you want to ensure that the routine includes an active alarm, use 
Alarm as the trigger Type (see ""Understanding Trigger Parameters” 
on page 395).
If you do not need the routine to wait until the alarm finishes, you can 
still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and Alarm as Feature Wait 
and set Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) to the desired 
amount of time to wait.
13.11.7.5 Feature-Wait Action Type with Announcement
If you want all active Normal and Emergency announcements to 
complete before continue with subsequent routine actions, use the 
Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (parameter 1) set to 
Announcement.
This action will not allow you to specify which announcement type or 
which announcement to wait for. The Announcement trigger Type 
does allow you to specify an announcement type or number (see 
""Understanding Trigger Parameters” on page 395). However, if the 
routine uses Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait set to 
Announcement and multiple announcements start, then the routine

Configuring E7000
After E7000 is installed on your server, you must configure your 
system and the E7000 features to best suit your organizational needs. 
For example, you must determine if your E7000 server is being used 
for just your school or for a multi-school campus environment. An 
example of a multi-school campus environment is when a middle 
school and a high school are on the same campus.
The following table provides the suggested order for setting up your 
system and directs you to specific sections of the E7000 documenta-
tion for step by step instructions.
Note: If an E7000 system server is used in a multi-school campus 
environment, All-Call and Emergency All-Call pages broadcast at 
all schools managed by that E7000 system server. If you do not 
want this setup, then each school on the campus should have its 
own E7000 system server. A single E7000 system server should not 
be used to manage multiple schools that are geographically sepa-
rated since WLAN and power issues at one school could disrupt 
E7000 service at all locations.

Configuring Ambient Noise Sensor
The Ambient Noise Sensor ensures that page announcements and 
music are audible even during periods of high noise levels by contin-
uously monitoring the ambient noise level through a microphone 
module and adjusting the paging signal level for that area's amplifier 
channel. 
This feature requires that an ANS500M Ambient Sound Microphone 
be attached to an intercom module station type. For installation 
instructions, refer to the NQ-GA10P, NQ-GA10PV VoIP Intercom 
Module Installation and Use manual.
You must set the Ambient Noise Sensor Multicast IP Address and 
Ambient Noise Sensor Multicast Port system parameters (see ""Set-
ting System Parameters” on page 53).
Then, create a station with Type as Ambient Noise Sensor and 
Device Type as NQ-GA10P-Intercom Module or NQ-GA10PV-
Intercom Module (see ""Adding a Station” on page 153). 
To configure ANS parameters:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
Select the Edit icon for the Ambient Noise Sensor sta-
tion.
Step 3
Select Configure.
Step 4
Select the Add icon to add an ANS Listener.
An ANS Listener is a station that will receive Sound 
Pressure Level (SPL) reports from the ANS. For example, 
suppose you have speakers in a warehouse area that 
you want the volume to automatically adjust when 
Figure 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor
145
noisy machines are operating. You would add the 
speaker stations as ANS Listeners. When the SPL in the 
warehouse increases, the ANS reports the increase to 
the ANS Listeners and the speakers’ volumes are 
adjusted automatically.
Step 5
Set the ANS parameters for the ANS Listener.
Step 6
If you want to remove a station from the ANS Listener 
list, select the Remove icon on the station’s row.
Step 7
When all edits are made, select Save.
Table 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor Parameters
Station
Displays the extension number of the station 
that is an ANS Listener. A station can only lis-
ten to one ANS.
Max Boost (dB)
Displays the maximum dB gain adjustment 
allowed. Setting this parameter to 0 disables 
any volume adjustments from the ambient 
noise sensor. The default value is 20 dB.
Threshold (dBFS)
Displays the decibels relative to full scale 
(dBFS) value at which point the device will 
adjust the volume to compensate for the 
increased ambient noise volume. This value 
should be between -40 and 0 dBFS. A fairly 
noisy environment is around -20 dBFS; quiet 
environments are in the range of -40 dBFS. 
The default value is -20 dBFS.
Volume Adjust 
(dB)
Displays the amount of decibels to stay 
above the ambient noise level. Setting this to 
0 disables any volume adjustments from the 
ANS. The default value is 12 dB.
Sample Length(s) 
Displays the ambient noise sampling length, 
which can range from 1 to 20 seconds. Short 
lengths provide quicker response to changes 
in the ambient noise; longer lengths will 
ignore sudden, short fluctuations in the 
ambient noise.

What file extension is needed for importing a routine?,"3
13Using Routines
381
Using Routines
A routine automatically launches a procedure, or sequence of 
actions, that the Nyquist system executes as a result of an input trig-
ger. Routines can support your crisis plans for situations such as 
school lockdown, weather events, or emergency evacuation.
A routine can be started manually via the Admin Phone or the Admin 
Web UI. 
A routine can also be automatically launched:
• By an event, such as playing a specific announcement
• Via third-party switch contact closures recognized by the Nyquist 
I/O Controller
• Via a Routines API that can be used by third-party systems, 
including fire systems, access control systems, and video security 
systems 
A routine that has Allow DTMF enabled does not need a trigger. 
However, most routines will have at least one associated trigger and 
one or more actions. For example, if an administrator manually trig-
gers a lockdown routine, several actions could result, such as:
• Play a lockdown announcement.
• Display lockdown instructions on monitors connected to NQ-
GA10PV devices.
• Close I/O controller output contacts to trigger third-party systems 
that lock doors.
• Initiate the check-in process.
Note: You should always run a test of a routine after creating or 
editing it.
382
• Launch an emergency all call announcement.
To use the Routines feature, you must have the appropriate permis-
sions (see ""Assigning and Editing Permissions” on page 176) and the 
station being used to launch the routine must have the CoS parame-
ter Execute Routines enabled. (see ""Using CoS Configuration” on 
page 61).
To allow a third-party system to launch a routine via the Routines API, 
you must enable Allow API for the routine.
You can import or export routines by selecting the appropriate 
button from the Routines view. When importing a routine, the rou-
tine file must have a .sql extension. See ""Exporting a Routine” on 
page 433 or ""Importing a Routine” on page 435 for more information. 
13.1
Launching and Stopping a Routine from the 
Admin Web UI
You can manually launch a routine that has Allow DTMF enabled 
and stop a running routine from the Admin Web UI.
In addition to the routine needing Allow DTMF enabled, the Admin 
Web UI must have Execute Routines CoS enabled (see ""Using CoS 
Configuration” on page 61).
To launch a routine from the Admin Web UI:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard

Is there a limit to the number of zones or stations within a multicast zone in the E7000 system?,"8
1.1.5
Multicast IP Addresses
A minimum of three multicast IP Addresses are required for an E7000
system:
• Emergency-All-Call Multicast RTP IP Address
• All-Call Multicast RTP IP Address
• Audio Distribution Multicast IP Address
These multicast RTP IP Addresses are entered when setting System
Parameters. 
If you want to use multicasting for zones, a multicast IP Address is
needed for each multicast zone. 
A zone is a collection of stations. E7000 stations consist of any SIP-
enabled device (personal computer (PC), tablet, smart phone), VoIP
speaker or VoIP phone connected to the system and assigned an
extension. No limit exists for the number of zones or for the number
of stations that can be in a multicast zone. 
Multicast IP Addresses for zones are set through the Zones menu and
are added when creating a zone or when editing a zone.
1.1.6
Multicast Ports
Multicast ports must be set for each multicast IP address. When set-
ting Multicast ports for zones, the port number must start with an
even number and a range of four is needed between port numbers.
For example, if Zone 1 uses Multicast Port Number 6010, then Zone 2
cannot use port 6011, 6012, or 6013.
1.1.7
IP Addresses
IP addresses (static or dynamic) are needed for each of the following
items:
• E7000 System Controller or server
• Each E7000 VoIP phone
• Each E7000 appliance

Viewing Check-In Status
For administrators, the Manage Check-In feature provides a color-
coded view of what classrooms have checked in, classrooms or sta-
tions that are not part of the check-in process, and those that should 
check-in but have not yet done so. 
To view check-in status:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.
Step 2
Under Calling/Paging, select Manage Check-In.
A separate tab appears so that you can toggle the 
dashboard and Manage Check-In views.
The status of each station appears in a color-coded box. The follow-
ing table explains the use of colors to describe status:
Note: You can also use the Maps feature to view check-in status.

When viewing triggers, the parameters appear as Parameter 1 and 
Parameter 2. On the Edit Trigger page, though, the parameter 
names and available selections change based on the Type. For exam-
ple, if Alarm is selected as Type, a field called Alarm appears with a 
drop-down menu that shows all of the tones with Type set to Alarm 
on the Tones page (see ""Viewing Available Tones” on page 256). 
If you select the trigger Type to Announcement, the Announce-
ment Type field appears. The selection for Announcement Type will 
appear as Parameter 1 on the Triggers page. For some Announce-
ment Types, additional information is needed. For instance, if you 
select Normal-Zone as the Announcement Type on the Edit Trigger 
page, the Zone field appears. From the Zone field, you can select All 
Speakers, Any Zone, or a specific zone. 
Some triggers have no parameters. For example, if you select Emerg-

What is the purpose of creating a routine in managing alerts for the Nyquist server?,"Deleting an Admin Group
16Managing Alerts
461
Managing Alerts
You can use Alert Filters and routines to manage if and how specific 
Emergency Alert System (EAS) events appear on the video display 
connected to the NQ-GA10PV. Your Nyquist server reads these EAS 
events, which include non-weather-related alerts, from the NWS.
To display EAS events:
Step 1
Decide which alerts you want to monitor and enable 
filters for those alerts, such as severity, certainty, and 
urgency (see ""Alert Filters Configuration” on page 462).
Step 2
Create a routine (see ""Adding a Routine” on page 387).
Step 3
Create an action for the routine that uses Display-Msg 
for the action Type (see ""Actions” on page 402).
Step 4
Ensure the Text for the action contains the variables for 
the alerts you want to display (see ""Setting Variables for 
the Display Message” on page 466).
16.1
Understanding Event Types
The EAS has created specific event types for monitoring that include:
• Weather-Related Events, such as a Tornado Warning
• Non-Weather-Related Events, such as a Shelter in Place Warning 
for non-weather situations 
Note: Nyquist can only display weather or other emergency alerts 
from the National Weather Service (NWS) if your Nyquist server 
has an Internet connection and has access to necessary websites 
(see ""Whitelisted Web Addresses” on page 3). 
462
• Administrative Events, such as an Administrative Message
Event types are categorized as:
• Advisory. An event that is not life-threatening but could cause 
inconvenience.
• Warning. An event that poses a significant threat to public safety 
or property and has a high probability of occurrence or is occur-
ring. 
• Watch. Conditions are favorable for the event occurring; does not 
mean the event will occur but it is possible.
• Emergency. An event that by itself would not kill or injure or 
cause property damage, but indirectly may cause other things to 
happen that result in a hazard. 
• Statement. A message containing follow up information to a 
warning, watch, or emergency.
• Message. Non-weather related messages, such as an Amber Alert.
• Test. An administrative event for a monthly or weekly test of the 
emergency alert system.
The specific criteria for issuing an emergency alert is dependent your 
location.

Telephony Environment
The Nyquist E7000 can interface with a customer’s telephony system
in the following ways:
• Network-based SIP trunks to PSTN or Cloud-based VoIP provider
• Network-based SIP Tie-Lines to the premises-based IP-PBX
• FXS ATA to the premises-based PBX or IP-PBX
Use of FXS ATA requires purchase/use of a third-party FXS VoIP Gate-
way device (for example, Cisco SPA112 Two Port Phone Adapter)
Using SIP trunks allows full bi-directional calling between any E7000
station and the IP-PBX/PBX/PSTN and supports features such as E-
911 calling, remote call transfer, and off-premise calling. The FXS ATA
option only allows a station on the PBX to dial through” to the
Nyquist system where it will receives a second dial tone to initiate
DTMF controlled paging, intercom calls, etc.
Set up an appointment with both Bogen Technical Support (800-995-

Using SIP trunks allows full bi-directional calling between any E7000
station and the IP-PBX/PBX/PSTN and supports features such as E-
911 calling, remote call transfer, and off-premise calling. The FXS ATA
option only allows a station on the PBX to dial through” to the
Nyquist system where it will receives a second dial tone to initiate
DTMF controlled paging, intercom calls, etc.
Set up an appointment with both Bogen Technical Support (800-995-
2809) and the PBX vendor or customer (if the customer maintains the
telephony system) to assist during integration of the E7000 and tele-
phony systems.

Additional Information
Additional information about Nyquist appliances’ specifications and
installation instructions can be obtained via the Bogen E7000 web
site (http://www.bogenedu.com/). 
1.3
Installation Checklist
The following checklist is provided to aid in obtaining information
needed for E7000 system installation and initial configuration. You
can print the checklist and use the Notes column to write required
information, such as multicast IP addresses. In some cases, such as
recording IP addresses for stations or VoIP phones, additional pages
may need to be copied to accommodate the total number of devices
being installed.
        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

","Yes, it may be necessary to copy additional pages for recording IP addresses for devices during installation, especially when accommodating the total number of stations or VoIP phones being installed. The installation checklist allows for additional notes, which can help keep track of this information.","According to the information, yes, it is necessary to copy additional pages for recording IP addresses for devices during installation.",It is necessary to copy additional pages for recording IP addresses for devices during installation if there are more devices being installed than can fit on the provided pages.

Step 4
Select the routine that you want to stop. 
Step 5
Select Yes.
13.2
Launching a Routine from the Admin Phone
You can manually launch a routine that has Allow DTMF enabled 
from an Admin Phone by doing one of the following:
• Dial *94<Routine-DTMF-Code>.
• Select the Routines menu from the Admin Phone and then select 
the routine that you want to launch. 
In addition to the routine needing Allow DTMF enabled, the Admin 
Phone must have Execute Routines CoS enabled (see ""Using CoS 
Configuration” on page 61).
If you disconnect the call during a routine, the routine continues until 
finished. If the routine includes Pause actions, the call will not discon-
nect until all Pause actions have been executed. 
A routine launched from the Admin Phone may end with any of the 
following page commands, provided the Admin Phone has the 
appropriate CoS enabled:
• All-Call
• Emergency-All-Call
• Facility-Page
• Multi-Site-All-Call
• Multi-Site-Emergency-All-Call
• Zone-Page
Note: Stopping a routine does not reverse any actions that the 
routine has already started. You may need to clear the actions 
manually.
Note: Only routines with Allow DTMF enabled appear in the 
menu.

Using the Routines API
You can allow third-party systems, such as access control systems, to 
launch a routine, or you can remotely launch a routine using the Rou-
tines API. 
The routine must be created from an Admin Station that has the CoS 
parameter Execute Routines enabled (see ""Using CoS Configuration” 
on page 61).
The routine must have the Allow API parameter enabled (see ""Edit-
ing a Routine” on page 387).
To remotely launch a routine using the Routines API:

server’s IP address
<routine_dtmf_code> is replaced by the routine’s DTMF 
code
<password> is replaced by the password associated 
with the extension defined in the routine. 
<delay_flag> is replaced by either 1 or 0. A setting of 1 
returns the status to the remote station after the rou-
tine finishes while a setting of 0 returns the status 
immediately after the routine launches.

Audio Distribution
Suppose you want to use an audio source, such as a radio station 
accessed via the Internet, in a cafeteria but prevent that source from 
being played in a conference room. This feature, called Audio Distri-
bution, can be turned on by zone (an area or group of stations) or 
stations (group of devices such as VoIP speakers). You can add the 
speakers, or stations, in the cafeteria to a zone that allows Audio Dis-
tribution while the speakers in a conference room would not be 
placed into that zone.
Audio Distribution involves creating a playlist or selecting an input 
source and specifying which zones hear the playlist or input source. 
Through the Scheduled Audio feature, Audio Distribution can be tied 
to a specific event in a schedule (see ""Adding an Event” on page 227).

Creating a Map Object for Check-In
To create a map object for an area or room, first follow the steps for 
adding an action object to your map (see ""Adding a Defined Action 
Object” on page 365).
To edit a defined action object:
Step 1
From the dashboard, ensure the Mode is Edit.
Step 2
Click the Edit icon on the selectable object.
Step 3
Complete the Edit parameters, ensuring that Action is 
set as Call. (See Table 12-2, “Edit Parameters,” on 
page 369 for more information about the available 
parameters.
Step 4
Select Save.
12.7.2
Monitoring Check-In
When Check-In is active, the Map panel changes to Live Mode and 
the Map objects for all stations being monitored will no longer show 
the Edit icon. Instead, you will see icons for Call, Listen, Video, and 
Information. 
The Listen icon only works if the station is associated with a speaker 
that allows two-way communication. The Video icon only works with 
Map objects that have been configured with a Video URL (see 
Table 12-2, “Edit Parameters,” on page 369). If the Map object isn’t 
large enough to display the icons, a hamburger menu (also known as 
a three-line menu or menu button) appears in the top right corner.
Note: You must create a defined action object for each room or 
area that you want to monitor.

Registering as a Third-Party SIP Endpoint
You can configure a Nyquist SIP trunk to register with a third-party 
SIP endpoint with an IP-PBX. This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX 
defined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.
The steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-
point for an IP-PBX are:
1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-
tem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-
point as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone 
with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the 
SIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk 
must use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the 
Add SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a 
DISA station. 
When an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-
ing call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-
sion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the 
Nyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to

SIP Trunk Custom Configuration Settings
The Custom Settings parameter can be used if additional parame-
ters are needed during SIP trunk configuration to satisfy SIP trunk 
provider requirements. Bogen Technical Support will provide any 
necessary custom settings. In most cases, Custom Settings are not 
required.
Custom Settings can be entered when adding or editing SIP Trunk 
parameters (see ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration Parameters” on 
page 72 or ""Editing a SIP Trunk Configuration” on page 81) using the 
following format:

In this format, TABLE-NAME is one of the following:
• ENDPOINT
• AOR
• AUTH
• SIPTRUNK
Variable is a valid variable from one of the pjsip tables (ps_endpoints, 
ps_aors, ps_auths) or sip_trunk table.

Registering as a Third-Party SIP Endpoint
You can configure a Nyquist SIP trunk to register with a third-party 
SIP endpoint with an IP-PBX. This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX 
defined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.
The steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-
point for an IP-PBX are:
1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-
tem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-
point as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone 
with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the 
SIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk 
must use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the 
Add SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a 
DISA station. 
When an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-
ing call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-
sion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the 
Nyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to 
initiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX 
Note: The station extension used for the DISA Line must be differ-
ent than the extension being used by your IP-PBX.

What is necessary to create a map object for monitoring Check-In?,"3
375
12.7
Using Maps for Check-In
From the Maps view, you can monitor Check-In or launch a routine 
that starts or stops Check-In.
To use Maps for Check-In, the following conditions must be met:
•  You have permissions configured to view maps (see ""Assigning 
and Editing Permissions” on page 203).
• Your station Type is Admin Web Interface or Web Interface (see 
""Editing Station Configuration Settings” on page 118).
• Check-In has been configured for your system (see ""Configuring 
Check-In” on page 453).
• You have an available map that shows the rooms or areas that you 
want to monitor (see ""Adding a Site Graphic” on page 364).
• You have created a map object for each station that you want to 
monitor (see ""Creating a Map Object for Check-In” on page 376).
To use a routine to start or stop Check-In, the routine must have been 
previously created with either a trigger or an action Type of Check-In. 
(see""Adding a Routine” on page 387). 
Figure 12-9, Maps Check-In View
Note: You can only listen in areas or rooms that allow two-way 
communications; in other words, the station in that room must be 
associated with a speaker with a microphone.

12.7.1
Creating a Map Object for Check-In
To create a map object for an area or room, first follow the steps for 
adding an action object to your map (see ""Adding a Defined Action 
Object” on page 365).
To edit a defined action object:
Step 1
From the dashboard, ensure the Mode is Edit.
Step 2
Click the Edit icon on the selectable object.
Step 3
Complete the Edit parameters, ensuring that Action is 
set as Call. (See Table 12-2, “Edit Parameters,” on 
page 369 for more information about the available 
parameters.
Step 4
Select Save.
12.7.2
Monitoring Check-In
When Check-In is active, the Map panel changes to Live Mode and 
the Map objects for all stations being monitored will no longer show 
the Edit icon. Instead, you will see icons for Call, Listen, Video, and 
Information. 
The Listen icon only works if the station is associated with a speaker 
that allows two-way communication. The Video icon only works with 
Map objects that have been configured with a Video URL (see 
Table 12-2, “Edit Parameters,” on page 369). If the Map object isn’t 
large enough to display the icons, a hamburger menu (also known as 
a three-line menu or menu button) appears in the top right corner.
Note: You must create a defined action object for each room or 
area that you want to monitor.

• You have created a map object for each station that you want to 
monitor (see ""Creating a Map Object for Check-In” on page 376).
To use a routine to start or stop Check-In, the routine must have been 
previously created with either a trigger or an action Type of Check-In. 
(see""Adding a Routine” on page 387).

Creating a Map Object for Check-In
To create a map object for an area or room, first follow the steps for 
adding an action object to your map (see ""Adding a Defined Action 
Object” on page 365).
To edit a defined action object:
Step 1
From the dashboard, ensure the Mode is Edit.
Step 2
Click the Edit icon on the selectable object.
Step 3
Complete the Edit parameters, ensuring that Action is 
set as Call. (See Table 12-2, “Edit Parameters,” on 
page 369 for more information about the available 
parameters.
Step 4
Select Save.
12.7.2
Monitoring Check-In
When Check-In is active, the Map panel changes to Live Mode and 
the Map objects for all stations being monitored will no longer show 
the Edit icon. Instead, you will see icons for Call, Listen, Video, and 
Information. 
The Listen icon only works if the station is associated with a speaker 
that allows two-way communication. The Video icon only works with 
Map objects that have been configured with a Video URL (see 
Table 12-2, “Edit Parameters,” on page 369). If the Map object isn’t 
large enough to display the icons, a hamburger menu (also known as 
a three-line menu or menu button) appears in the top right corner.
Note: You must create a defined action object for each room or 
area that you want to monitor.

Viewing I/O Controller Configuration Rules
The I/O Controller allows Nyquist to recognize third-party switch 
contact closures and to provide external circuits. Configuration rules 
can be set for each input and output port on an I/O Controller, so, for 
example, you can set a rule that if a contact is opened than an alarm 
sounds or set a rule that if a doorbell rings, an Admin user can trigger 
another rule that opens the door.
To view the configuration rules for an I/O Controller:

nel).
Note: The I/O Controller can only be used to start audio 
distribution to all stations; it cannot stop the audio to all 
stations. Another method must be used to stop the audio 
such as selecting Stop from the Admin Web Interface or 
Admin Phone.
• Alarm – Plays the alarm file selected as the Action ID.
• Announcement – Plays the announcement file selected 
as the Action ID.
• Disable-Audio – Disables all audio in the Nyquist sys-
tem, performing the same action as when the Disable 
Audio button on the dashboard is selected. This action 
can be used by an external emergency system (for exam-
ple, fire alarms) to disable all Nyquist audio, which 
includes: Audio Distribution, Tones, Alarms, Paging. 
Note: This contact closure action will only initiate the dis-
abling of audio, it will not restore the audio. To restore 
audio, use a different contact with the action Enable Audio, 
or enable audio via an Admin Web Interface or Admin 
Phone.
• Other – Used when you don’t want to take one of the 
available actions, but you do want to close a contact, 
create a dashboard message, or send an email when the 
contact is closed.
• Tone – Plays the tone file selected as the Action ID.
• Enable-Audio – Enables all audio in the Nyquist system, 
performing the same action as when the Enable Audio 
button is selected on the dashboard.

Viewing I/O Controller Configuration Rules
The I/O Controller allows Nyquist to recognize third-party switch 
contact closures and to provide external circuits. Configuration rules 
can be set for each input and output port on an I/O Controller, so, for 
example, you can set a rule that if a contact is opened than an alarm 
sounds or set a rule that if a doorbell rings, an Admin user can trigger 
another rule that opens the door.

What initial step must be taken on an IP-PBX system to set up a third-party SIP phone?,"Configuring E7000

Value is a valid value for a specified variable.
Contact Technical Support for information regarding Custom Set-
tings for your specific IP-PBX type and configuration.
2.3.6
Registering as a Third-Party SIP Endpoint
You can configure a Nyquist SIP trunk to register with a third-party 
SIP endpoint with an IP-PBX. This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX 
defined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.
The steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-
point for an IP-PBX are:
1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-
tem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-
point as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone 
with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the

2.3.6
Registering as a Third-Party SIP Endpoint
You can configure a Nyquist SIP trunk to register with a third-party 
SIP endpoint with an IP-PBX. This will allow users to dial an IP-PBX 
defined extension to initiate Nyquist features, such as paging.
The steps to register the Nyquist SIP trunk as a third-party SIP end-
point for an IP-PBX are:
1 Define a Third-Party SIP Phone/Endpoint on your IP-PBX sys-
tem. On the IP-PBX system, set up a third-party SIP phone/end-
point as you would for a standard single-line basic SIP IP phone 
with a username and password to use for authentication. Typically, 
the username would be the extension number. The Nyquist system 
will attempt to register with your IP-PBX system as a SIP endpoint 
extension using the provided username (extension) and password 
pair. Your IP-PBX users will dial the provided IP-PBX extension to 
access the Nyquist system.
2 Define a DISA station on Nyquist system. On the Nyquist Sys-
tem, create a DISA Line station Type. This station’s extension will 
define the feature CoS permissions to be used when the IP-PBX 
calls into the Nyquist system. 
3 Define a SIP Trunk on Nyquist system. Configure a Nyquist SIP 
Trunk using the username (PBX extension) and password that was 
defined on your IP-PBX in step 1.
For example, suppose the IP-PBX has defined extension 511 as the 
SIP endpoint with password testpassword. The Nyquist SIP trunk 
must use 511 in the Name, Username, and DID parameters on the 
Add SIP Trunk page. Nyquist station extension 500 is defined as a 
DISA station. 
When an IP-PBX user calls 511, the Nyquist system will see an incom-
ing call to extension 511. Nyquist converts to the DISA station exten-
sion 500 (to provide CoS definitions for 511 and Caller-ID to the 
Nyquist system). DISA will be started, allowing the IP-PBX caller to 
initiate a feature on the Nyquist system. When DISA starts, the IP-PBX

2.3.1
How Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls
When a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on 
that SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter 
set in the Nyquist SIP trunk’s parameters. The Access parameter is set 
when editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see ""Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 and ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-
tion.
Based on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-
lowing:
• Routes the call to a DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
DISA functionality:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• DISA – Incoming only – No password
• DISA – Incoming only – Password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password
When the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will 
hear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any 
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a 
Nyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller 
can dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See ""Nyquist 
DTMF Feature Dialing Codes” on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)
When incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk 
Extension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type 
DISA Line; the associated station’s CoS configuration is used to 
determine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed 
to initiate. (See ""Adding CoS Parameters for a Station” on page 67.) 
Note: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-
tem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are 
ignored.
69
The Extension parameter is also used as the caller ID when a DISA 
user dials a station extension.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to 
Security DISA functionality:
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Security DISA – Incoming – Listen only
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, security DISA
The caller must enter a valid extension to be monitored and can only 
listen to calls or station locations.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
defined Day or Night Admin:
• Unrestricted
• Incoming Only
If the Day or Night Admin does not answer the incoming call, the call 
is routed, or rolled over, to the Admin Group. (See ""Using Admin 
Groups” on page 211.) 
If the call is not answered during night hours and the Night Ring 
option is enabled, the call is routed using the Night Ring functional-
ity. (See ""Setting Night Call Options” on page 31.) 
2.3.2
How Nyquist Handles Outgoing SIP Calls
Nyquist users can initiate outside calls by dialing a number that starts 
with the outside call prefix (98). Outside calls are only sent to SIP 
Trunks that have one of the following Access settings:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No Password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Unrestricted
• Outgoing Only
Note: Use the PBX Connection options only if the PBX accepts 7-
digit and 10-digit domestic and 12digit international PSTN tele-
phone numbers and can initiate outbound calls to specified tele-
phone numbers.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Managing SIP Trunks
A SIP trunk is an IP based network connection between Nyquist and 
an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP), which is also known as 
a VoIP telephone service provider. It allows you to use VoIP tele-
phony beyond the facility’s firewall without the need for a Public 
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), providing a configuration that 
is easier and less expensive to operate and maintain. SIP trunks can 
carry VoIP calls, Enhanced 911, and other real-time communications 
services. 
A SIP Tie-Trunk (or a SIP Tie-Line) functions similarly to a SIP trunk, 
but serves as an IP based inter-connection between Nyquist and a 
local (premises-based) or hosted IP-PBX. For information about using 
SIP Tie-Trunks with Nyquist, refer to ""SIP Trunk Custom Configuration 
Settings” on page 75.
Before you can set SIP parameters in Nyquist, you must first set up 
the system's DISA function by creating a station with the Type of 
DISA Line. (See ""Adding a Station” on page 153.)
If you will require support from Bogen during the implementation 
process, you must install Teamviewer on the Nyquist system server 
and enable Remote access capabilities in the LAN to allow a remote 
connection to the server. In addition, Wireshark must be installed in 
the Nyquist system server to allow packet inspection during SIP 
implementation and troubleshooting. It is recommended that the 
technician performing the install be skilled with SIP implementation 
and testing. The Firewall setting must allow Port 5060 and Ports 
10000 – 20000 for the RTP traffic. Any other type of SIP connectivity 
could be available via an individual case basis process.

2.3.1
How Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls
When a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on 
that SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter 
set in the Nyquist SIP trunk’s parameters. The Access parameter is set 
when editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see ""Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 and ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-
tion.
Based on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-
lowing:
• Routes the call to a DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
DISA functionality:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• DISA – Incoming only – No password
• DISA – Incoming only – Password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password
When the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will 
hear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any 
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a 
Nyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller 
can dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See ""Nyquist 
DTMF Feature Dialing Codes” on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)
When incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk 
Extension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type

Managing SIP Trunks
A SIP trunk is an IP based network connection between Nyquist and 
an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP), which is also known as 
a VoIP telephone service provider. It allows you to use VoIP tele-
phony beyond the facility’s firewall without the need for a Public 
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), providing a configuration that 
is easier and less expensive to operate and maintain. SIP trunks can 
carry VoIP calls, Enhanced 911, and other real-time communications 
services. 
A SIP Tie-Trunk (or a SIP Tie-Line) functions similarly to a SIP trunk, 
but serves as an IP based inter-connection between Nyquist and a 
local (premises-based) or hosted IP-PBX. For information about using 
SIP Tie-Trunks with Nyquist, refer to ""SIP Trunk Custom Configuration 
Settings” on page 75.
Before you can set SIP parameters in Nyquist, you must first set up 
the system's DISA function by creating a station with the Type of 
DISA Line. (See ""Adding a Station” on page 153.)
If you will require support from Bogen during the implementation 
process, you must install Teamviewer on the Nyquist system server 
and enable Remote access capabilities in the LAN to allow a remote 
connection to the server. In addition, Wireshark must be installed in 
the Nyquist system server to allow packet inspection during SIP 
implementation and troubleshooting. It is recommended that the 
technician performing the install be skilled with SIP implementation 
and testing. The Firewall setting must allow Port 5060 and Ports 
10000 – 20000 for the RTP traffic. Any other type of SIP connectivity 
could be available via an individual case basis process.

2.3.1
How Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls
When a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on 
that SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter 
set in the Nyquist SIP trunk’s parameters. The Access parameter is set 
when editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see ""Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 and ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-
tion.
Based on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-
lowing:
• Routes the call to a DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
DISA functionality:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• DISA – Incoming only – No password
• DISA – Incoming only – Password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password
When the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will 
hear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any 
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a 
Nyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller 
can dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See ""Nyquist 
DTMF Feature Dialing Codes” on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)
When incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk 
Extension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type 
DISA Line; the associated station’s CoS configuration is used to 
determine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed 
to initiate. (See ""Adding CoS Parameters for a Station” on page 67.) 
Note: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-
tem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are 
ignored.

3.2.10
Configuring Ambient Noise Sensor
The Ambient Noise Sensor ensures that page announcements and 
music are audible even during periods of high noise levels by contin-
uously monitoring the ambient noise level through a microphone 
module and adjusting the paging signal level for that area's amplifier 
channel. 
This feature requires that an ANS500M Ambient Sound Microphone 
be attached to an intercom module station type. For installation 
instructions, refer to the NQ-GA10P, NQ-GA10PV VoIP Intercom 
Module Installation and Use manual.
You must set the Ambient Noise Sensor Multicast IP Address and 
Ambient Noise Sensor Multicast Port system parameters (see ""Set-
ting System Parameters” on page 53).
Then, create a station with Type as Ambient Noise Sensor and 
Device Type as NQ-GA10P-Intercom Module or NQ-GA10PV-
Intercom Module (see ""Adding a Station” on page 153). 
To configure ANS parameters:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
Select the Edit icon for the Ambient Noise Sensor sta-
tion.
Step 3
Select Configure.
Step 4
Select the Add icon to add an ANS Listener.
An ANS Listener is a station that will receive Sound 
Pressure Level (SPL) reports from the ANS. For example, 
suppose you have speakers in a warehouse area that 
you want the volume to automatically adjust when 
Figure 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor
145
noisy machines are operating. You would add the 
speaker stations as ANS Listeners. When the SPL in the 
warehouse increases, the ANS reports the increase to 
the ANS Listeners and the speakers’ volumes are 
adjusted automatically.
Step 5
Set the ANS parameters for the ANS Listener.
Step 6
If you want to remove a station from the ANS Listener 
list, select the Remove icon on the station’s row.
Step 7
When all edits are made, select Save.
Table 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor Parameters
Station
Displays the extension number of the station 
that is an ANS Listener. A station can only lis-
ten to one ANS.
Max Boost (dB)
Displays the maximum dB gain adjustment 
allowed. Setting this parameter to 0 disables 
any volume adjustments from the ambient 
noise sensor. The default value is 20 dB.
Threshold (dBFS)
Displays the decibels relative to full scale 
(dBFS) value at which point the device will 
adjust the volume to compensate for the 
increased ambient noise volume. This value 
should be between -40 and 0 dBFS. A fairly 
noisy environment is around -20 dBFS; quiet 
environments are in the range of -40 dBFS. 
The default value is -20 dBFS.
Volume Adjust 
(dB)
Displays the amount of decibels to stay 
above the ambient noise level. Setting this to 
0 disables any volume adjustments from the 
ANS. The default value is 12 dB.
Sample Length(s) 
Displays the ambient noise sampling length, 
which can range from 1 to 20 seconds. Short 
lengths provide quicker response to changes 
in the ambient noise; longer lengths will 
ignore sudden, short fluctuations in the 
ambient noise.

Configuring Ambient Noise Sensor
The Ambient Noise Sensor ensures that page announcements and 
music are audible even during periods of high noise levels by contin-
uously monitoring the ambient noise level through a microphone 
module and adjusting the paging signal level for that area's amplifier 
channel. 
This feature requires that an ANS500M Ambient Sound Microphone 
be attached to an intercom module station type. For installation 
instructions, refer to the NQ-GA10P, NQ-GA10PV VoIP Intercom 
Module Installation and Use manual.
You must set the Ambient Noise Sensor Multicast IP Address and 
Ambient Noise Sensor Multicast Port system parameters (see ""Set-
ting System Parameters” on page 53).
Then, create a station with Type as Ambient Noise Sensor and 
Device Type as NQ-GA10P-Intercom Module or NQ-GA10PV-
Intercom Module (see ""Adding a Station” on page 153). 
To configure ANS parameters:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Stations.
Step 2
Select the Edit icon for the Ambient Noise Sensor sta-
tion.
Step 3
Select Configure.
Step 4
Select the Add icon to add an ANS Listener.
An ANS Listener is a station that will receive Sound 
Pressure Level (SPL) reports from the ANS. For example, 
suppose you have speakers in a warehouse area that 
you want the volume to automatically adjust when 
Figure 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor
145
noisy machines are operating. You would add the 
speaker stations as ANS Listeners. When the SPL in the 
warehouse increases, the ANS reports the increase to 
the ANS Listeners and the speakers’ volumes are 
adjusted automatically.
Step 5
Set the ANS parameters for the ANS Listener.
Step 6
If you want to remove a station from the ANS Listener 
list, select the Remove icon on the station’s row.
Step 7
When all edits are made, select Save.
Table 3-9, Configure Ambient Noise Sensor Parameters
Station
Displays the extension number of the station 
that is an ANS Listener. A station can only lis-
ten to one ANS.
Max Boost (dB)
Displays the maximum dB gain adjustment 
allowed. Setting this parameter to 0 disables 
any volume adjustments from the ambient 
noise sensor. The default value is 20 dB.
Threshold (dBFS)
Displays the decibels relative to full scale 
(dBFS) value at which point the device will 
adjust the volume to compensate for the 
increased ambient noise volume. This value 
should be between -40 and 0 dBFS. A fairly 
noisy environment is around -20 dBFS; quiet 
environments are in the range of -40 dBFS. 
The default value is -20 dBFS.
Volume Adjust 
(dB)
Displays the amount of decibels to stay 
above the ambient noise level. Setting this to 
0 disables any volume adjustments from the 
ANS. The default value is 12 dB.
Sample Length(s) 
Displays the ambient noise sampling length, 
which can range from 1 to 20 seconds. Short 
lengths provide quicker response to changes 
in the ambient noise; longer lengths will 
ignore sudden, short fluctuations in the 
ambient noise.

calls are received during night hours. The specified stations 
will ring for up to 30 minutes, then hang up if the call is not 
answered within that time.
Server IP Address
Identifies the server’s IP address. To change the server’s IP 
address, select Change Server IP Address and then select 
the correct IP address from the menu that appears.
Parking Lot
Defines the range of numbers to use for call parking. The 
first number listed is used to initiate call parking, which is a 
feature that allows you to put a call on hold at one tele-
phone set and continue the conversation from any other 
telephone set.
Record Monitoring
Indicates if call and location monitoring will be recorded.
Emergency Link
Specifies the station that functions as the system’s Emer-
gency Link Station. An Emergency Link Station is the station 
that an emergency call (but not a 911 call) is routed to if the 
station’s associated Admin Station is busy, rejects the call, 
or fails to answer within 15 seconds. A value of 999 means 
that this feature is disabled.
If the Emergency Link Station is a ringable device (a Nyquist 
phone), the station will ring and the call will be displayed 
on the station’s display (if so equipped) as an “Emergency 
Call.” If the Emergency Link Station is not a ringable device 
(a Nyquist VoIP speaker), the station will auto-answer, pre-
announcing the call as an “Emergency.” The Admin Station 
will continue to ring if an emergency call is auto-answered 
by a non-ringable Emergency Link Station device. The 
Admin Station can retrieve the call by answering it, and the 
Emergency Link Station device will then drop the call. As 
with any Emergency Call, all calls to an Emergency Link Sta-
tion will be recorded.
Max Restricted Digits
Specifies the maximum number of digits that can be dialed 
if a station has been assigned restricted outside line access.
CDR Storage Duration

interrupted after the user enters a PIN.
Allow Multi-Site-Emer-
gency-All-Call Inter-
rupt
When enabled, Emergency-All-Call pages can be inter-
rupted by Multi-Site-Emergency-All-Call pages.
Auth Code
Allows you to enable additional features on a telephone 
when the walking CoS feature is enabled. The four-digit 
code activates features from the associated phone to the 
phone being used. (Auth is an abbreviation for Authoriza-
tion.) If set to 0000, the walking CoS feature is disabled.

first number listed is used to initiate call parking, which is a 
feature that allows you to put a call on hold at one tele-
phone set and continue the conversation from any other 
telephone set.
Record Monitoring
Indicates if call and location monitoring will be recorded.
Emergency Link
Specifies the station that functions as the system’s Emer-
gency Link Station. An Emergency Link Station is the station 
that an emergency call (but not a 911 call) is routed to if the 
station’s associated Admin Station is busy, rejects the call, 
or fails to answer within 15 seconds. A value of 999 means 
that this feature is disabled.
If the Emergency Link Station is a ringable device (a Nyquist 
phone), the station will ring and the call will be displayed 
on the station’s display (if so equipped) as an “Emergency 
Call.” If the Emergency Link Station is not a ringable device 
(a Nyquist VoIP speaker), the station will auto-answer, pre-
announcing the call as an “Emergency.” The Admin Station 
will continue to ring if an emergency call is auto-answered 
by a non-ringable Emergency Link Station device. The 
Admin Station can retrieve the call by answering it, and the 
Emergency Link Station device will then drop the call. As 
with any Emergency Call, all calls to an Emergency Link Sta-
tion will be recorded.
Max Restricted Digits
Specifies the maximum number of digits that can be dialed 
if a station has been assigned restricted outside line access.
CDR Storage Duration

gency-All-Call Inter-
rupt
When enabled, Emergency-All-Call pages can be inter-
rupted by Multi-Site-Emergency-All-Call pages.
Auth Code
Allows you to enable additional features on a telephone 
when the walking CoS feature is enabled. The four-digit 
code activates features from the associated phone to the 
phone being used. (Auth is an abbreviation for Authoriza-
tion.) If set to 0000, the walking CoS feature is disabled.

","The Day Start time indicates when the system transitions to ""Day"" mode, during which the day Admin Station is active, and calls with night-only outside line access are restricted. Conversely, the Night Start time marks the switch to ""Night"" mode, enabling night Admin Station access for outside line calls. Proper configuration of these times ensures calls are routed correctly based on the time of day.","The significance of the Day Start and Night Start times in system operation is that they determine when the system switches between its ""Day"" and ""Night"" modes of operation.

During the Day mode, telephones with night-only outside line access are prevented from placing outside line calls. This is to ensure that only authorized personnel can make outside calls during the day.

During the Night mode, telephones with night-only outside line access can place outside line calls. This allows authorized personnel to make outside calls during the night.

3 Managing Stations, 
Zones, and Queues
105
Managing Stations, Zones, and 
Queues
You can divide your facility into zones to control paging and audio 
activities or features. For example, suppose you want to allow the use 
of an audio source, such as a flash drive, in a cafeteria but prevent it 
from being played in a conference room. This feature, called audio 
distribution, can be turned on by zone, so the cafeteria could be 
placed in a zone that allows audio distribution while conference 
rooms would not be placed into that zone.
No limit exists for the number of zones or for the number of stations 
that can be in a multicast zone. Performance limits do exist for unicast 
connections. The station limit for your system is determined by your 
license (see ""NQ-E7000SSL – Nyquist E7000 System Station License” 
on page 486).
With the Page Queuing feature, you can record an unlimited number 
of pages or messages for queuing (stacking) for a specified zone or 
zones. A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may 
have multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before 
a queue can be created.
A station can be in multiple zones.
An E7000 station is: 
• A device used to access the web interface
• A speaker
• A phone 
• A Nyquist appliance

Deleting a Station
When you delete a station, all of its settings are deleted and the sta-
tion will not be able to register with the Nyquist system server. If it’s 
an admin station, you may not be able to delete it until you delete all

associations that the Admin Station has (for example, member of Day 
Admin, Night Admin, Night Ring, or Admin Group). 
After you delete a second station from an SPA112, the Nyquist 
system server reboots the SPA112. If the Nyquist system server does 
not know the SPA112's IP Address, you must reboot the SPA112 
device for the changes to take effect on the SPA112. 
When a station is deleted from an SPA112, it can take several minutes 
for the changes to show up on the SPA112's web interface. When the 
second station is deleted from the SPA112, the remaining station is 
set up on the first port (Phone 1) even if that station was previously 
set up on the second port (Phone 2). If this situation occurs, move the 
attached phone cable from Phone 2 to Phone 1.

delete configuration settings.

Adding a Station
Using the Nyquist system server’s automatic discovery feature is the 
preferred method of adding a station. If you manually add a station, 
you risk having the MAC address entered incorrectly, which would 
prevent the station from functioning properly.
If the station Type is Admin Web Interface, Admin Phone, IP Phone, 
Analog Phone, or Mobile Device, you can set a default Announce-
ment Zone and the Announcement Zone Configuration Type. If 
the Announcement Zone Configuration Type is set to Fixed, the 
zone used to play announcements will always be the zone number 
provided for Announcement Zone and cannot be changed. If set to 
Default, the Announcement Zone value is used as the default zone, 
but you can set an announcement to play to another zone.

Managing Exclusion and Vacancy Lists
A station added to the Vacancy List and a station added to the Exclu-
sion List both appear gray on the Admin Station’s Check-In page if 
the Check-In page is configured to display these lists (see ""Configur-
ing Check-In” on page 453). The difference between the two lists, 
though, is that stations on the Exclusion List should always be 
excluded from the check-in process. Those on the Vacancy List, are 
stations (classrooms or areas) that normally would be checking in but 
may be vacant when the check-in process is started. 
A station on the vacancy list can still check in. This could occur during 
an emergency situation where a normally vacant classroom becomes

Playing Songs Directly from a USB Memory 
Stick
You can use a USB memory stick as storage for songs that can be 
played via the playlists feature.
To add songs and create a playlist for a USB memory stick, you must 
create a root file on the USB memory stick called MusicLibrary.txt. 
This file can contain the following entries:
• playlistname=<text entered by customer>
• createplaylist=no
• useexistingplaylist=yes
If createplaylist=no is found in MusicLibrary.txt, a playlist is not cre-
ated for the imported files.
If useexistingplaylist=yes is used, new songs will be added to the 
playlist defined by the playlistname option.
Music files must be on the root directory of the USB memory stick. 
Valid formats for these files are mp3, wav, and aac.
The Nyquist server automatically mounts the USB memory stick, adds 
all songs found in the root directory to the songs list, and creates a

359
Using the Maps Feature
With the Maps feature, you can select rooms, buildings, or other 
defined areas, such as bus loading zones or sports fields, from a 
graphic image to launch intercom calls or pages. You can use the 
Maps view to display Check-In status, listen to classrooms, and if the 
classroom has a camera, view video of the classroom. You can also 
create buttons to open a URL or execute a previously created routine.
To use the Maps feature, you must have the appropriate permissions 
(see ""Assigning Maps Panel Permissions” on page 361).
When setting maps up in a Nyquist system environment, you can 
import JPEG or PNG graphics of your facility, buildings, rooms, or 
objects, such as icons or landmarks. You can then set up various 
defined action objects. Action objects are interactive shapes on the 
map that allow the launching of intercom calls or zone pages.
Nyquist also supports multiple maps for multi-site campuses. Each 
site can define its own map objects and restrict calls and paging to its 
own administrator. 
Maps can have an unlimited number of levels, so, for example, an 
office administrator could navigate to a building, a specific floor in 
the building, and a specific room on the selected floor. For locations 
that are frequently called or paged, a defined action object can be 
placed as a button on a top level or sub level view so that navigating 
through multiple levels of maps is not required to initiate a call or 
page.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Using the Maps Feature
With the Maps feature, you can select rooms, buildings, or other 
defined areas, such as bus loading zones or sports fields, from a 
graphic image to launch intercom calls or pages. You can use the 
Maps view to display Check-In status, listen to classrooms, and if the 
classroom has a camera, view video of the classroom. You can also 
create buttons to open a URL or execute a previously created routine.
To use the Maps feature, you must have the appropriate permissions 
(see ""Assigning Maps Panel Permissions” on page 361).
When setting maps up in a Nyquist system environment, you can 
import JPEG or PNG graphics of your facility, buildings, rooms, or 
objects, such as icons or landmarks. You can then set up various 
defined action objects. Action objects are interactive shapes on the 
map that allow the launching of intercom calls or zone pages.
Nyquist also supports multiple maps for multi-site campuses. Each 
site can define its own map objects and restrict calls and paging to its 
own administrator. 
Maps can have an unlimited number of levels, so, for example, an 
office administrator could navigate to a building, a specific floor in 
the building, and a specific room on the selected floor. For locations 
that are frequently called or paged, a defined action object can be 
placed as a button on a top level or sub level view so that navigating 
through multiple levels of maps is not required to initiate a call or 
page.
        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

","Yes, maps in the Nyquist system can contain multiple levels, allowing users to navigate through buildings, floors, and specific rooms. The advantage of this multi-level structure is that it enables quick access to frequently called or paged locations without the need to navigate through multiple map levels, enhancing efficiency and ease of use.","According to the information, yes, maps in the Nyquist system can contain multiple levels. The advantage is that it allows for navigation to a specific location without requiring the user to navigate through multiple levels of maps. For example, an office administrator can navigate to a building, a specific floor in the building, and a specific room on the selected floor.","Yes, maps in the Nyquist system can contain multiple levels. This allows for more specific navigation and targeting of locations, such as navigating to a building, a specific floor in the building, and a specific room on the selected floor. Additionally, defined action objects can be placed as buttons on top-level or sub-level views to simplify the process of initiating calls or pages for frequently targeted locations."

Using System Log Files
A log file records either events or messages that occur when software 
runs and is used when troubleshooting the system. The following 
parts of the Nyquist system generate log files:
• Server (This provides access to the Debian Linux OS server log 
files.)
• Nyquist E7000 (This provides access to the Nyquist application log 
files.)
• Web Server (This provides access to the web server log files.)
From the web-based UI, system logs can be viewed directly or 
exported via download to your PC, Mac, or Android device and then 
copied to removable media or attached to an email to technical sup-
port.

Tuning Volume with White or Pink Noise
Nyquist provides white noise and pink noise files to help tune, or 
adjust, the volume of speakers in a zone.
White noise has equal energy for each frequency that the human ear 
can hear. Pink noise sounds less harsh than white noise because 
humans hear in octaves (the doubling of a frequency band). The 
energy in pink noise decreases by half as the frequency doubles, 
making the noise sound more balanced.
Both white and pink noise files are provided by default in Nyquist as 
both tones and songs. You can use the tone files as a tone generator 
to help adjust volume and frequency for pages in time-based zones. 
You can use the song files to help adjust volume and frequency in 
audio zones that play audio distribution.
Remember that when creating, editing, or viewing a zone, the Type 
identifies the zone as being able to receive paging, time, audio, or a 
combination of paging, time, or audio. (See ""Viewing Zone Informa-
tion” on page 168.)
To launch a white noise or pink noise file as a tone, follow the steps 
listed in ""Managing Tones Via the Dashboard” on page 346, selecting 
either the White Noise or Pink Noise file.
To play a white noise or pink noise file to a zone that plays audio dis-
tribution, first create a playlist that contains the white or pink noise 
song (see ""Creating a Playlist” on page 259) and then follow the steps 
listed in ""Using Audio Distribution” on page 353 to launch the audio 
distribution. 
If the zone can receive a combination of paging, time, and audio, you 
should use both the tone files and the song files to tune the speaker 
volume.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Tuning Volume with White or Pink Noise
Nyquist provides white noise and pink noise files to help tune, or 
adjust, the volume of speakers in a zone.
White noise has equal energy for each frequency that the human ear 
can hear. Pink noise sounds less harsh than white noise because 
humans hear in octaves (the doubling of a frequency band). The 
energy in pink noise decreases by half as the frequency doubles, 
making the noise sound more balanced.
Both white and pink noise files are provided by default in Nyquist as 
both tones and songs. You can use the tone files as a tone generator 
to help adjust volume and frequency for pages in time-based zones. 
You can use the song files to help adjust volume and frequency in 
audio zones that play audio distribution.
Remember that when creating, editing, or viewing a zone, the Type 
identifies the zone as being able to receive paging, time, audio, or a 
combination of paging, time, or audio. (See ""Viewing Zone Informa-
tion” on page 168.)
To launch a white noise or pink noise file as a tone, follow the steps 
listed in ""Managing Tones Via the Dashboard” on page 346, selecting 
either the White Noise or Pink Noise file.
To play a white noise or pink noise file to a zone that plays audio dis-
tribution, first create a playlist that contains the white or pink noise 
song (see ""Creating a Playlist” on page 259) and then follow the steps 
listed in ""Using Audio Distribution” on page 353 to launch the audio 
distribution. 
If the zone can receive a combination of paging, time, and audio, you 
should use both the tone files and the song files to tune the speaker 
volume.
        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

","In pink noise, the energy decreases by half as the frequency doubles, resulting in a more balanced sound that is less harsh than white noise. In contrast, white noise has equal energy across all frequencies that the human ear can hear.","According to the information, pink noise sounds less harsh than white noise because the energy in pink noise decreases by half as the frequency doubles, making the noise sound more balanced.","Pink noise has a more gradual decrease in energy as the frequency doubles, which results in a sound that is perceived as more balanced and less harsh compared to white noise. In contrast, white noise has equal energy across all frequencies, making it sound more uniform but also potentially more unpleasant."

Contact closures can be set for specific dates and times using the 
Configure Schedule button on the I/O Controller’s Edit Station page. 
For example, suppose you want to schedule an output that unlocks a 
door at 7:30 each weekday morning. You can set up an output con-
tact closure schedule for 7:30 am Monday through Friday. When the 
Activity Time occurs, the contact is closed, which in turn triggers a 
third-party contact switch that closes the door.
Days

Viewing I/O Controller Configuration Rules
The I/O Controller allows Nyquist to recognize third-party switch 
contact closures and to provide external circuits. Configuration rules 
can be set for each input and output port on an I/O Controller, so, for 
example, you can set a rule that if a contact is opened than an alarm 
sounds or set a rule that if a doorbell rings, an Admin user can trigger 
another rule that opens the door.
To view the configuration rules for an I/O Controller:
Step 1
From the navigation bar, select Stations.

Configuring E7000
After E7000 is installed on your server, you must configure your 
system and the E7000 features to best suit your organizational needs. 
For example, you must determine if your E7000 server is being used 
for just your school or for a multi-school campus environment. An 
example of a multi-school campus environment is when a middle 
school and a high school are on the same campus.
The following table provides the suggested order for setting up your 
system and directs you to specific sections of the E7000 documenta-
tion for step by step instructions.
Note: If an E7000 system server is used in a multi-school campus 
environment, All-Call and Emergency All-Call pages broadcast at 
all schools managed by that E7000 system server. If you do not 
want this setup, then each school on the campus should have its 
own E7000 system server. A single E7000 system server should not 
be used to manage multiple schools that are geographically sepa-
rated since WLAN and power issues at one school could disrupt 
E7000 service at all locations.

Using the Routines API
You can allow third-party systems, such as access control systems, to 
launch a routine, or you can remotely launch a routine using the Rou-
tines API. 
The routine must be created from an Admin Station that has the CoS 
parameter Execute Routines enabled (see ""Using CoS Configuration” 
on page 61).
The routine must have the Allow API parameter enabled (see ""Edit-
ing a Routine” on page 387).
To remotely launch a routine using the Routines API:
Step 1
On the browser’s address line, type:
http://<server_ip_address>/routine/api/<routine_dtm-
f_code>/<password>/<delay_flag>
where:
 <server_ip_address> is replaced by the Nyquist 
server’s IP address
<routine_dtmf_code> is replaced by the routine’s DTMF 
code
<password> is replaced by the password associated 
with the extension defined in the routine. 
<delay_flag> is replaced by either 1 or 0. A setting of 1 
returns the status to the remote station after the rou-
tine finishes while a setting of 0 returns the status 
immediately after the routine launches.
Note: The routine cannot end with a paging action or any call type 
action that requires a user to speak.

Using the Holidays Management Tool
Holidays, which can be a single day or a range of dates, often require 
changes in schedule assignments. The holidays management tool 
allows you to enter ranges of days when all schedules are turned off 
and to add these holidays to the calendar via the Schedules feature. 
You can also export a holiday schedule as a .csv file and import the holi-
day schedule file to another Nyquist server. 
Holidays override other schedules that are set for a date range.

Viewing Holidays
Holidays affect the schedule of each facility managed by your 
Nyquist server. The Holidays page displays a list of all holidays that 
have been set up for the Nyquist system. Holidays take precedent 
over regular schedules. For example, suppose you configure Mon-
days to use a schedule called Regular that has tones sounding 
throughout the day to mark the ending and beginning of shift 
changes. If you set a holiday for Monday, May 28, then the holiday 
“overrules” the Regular schedule and tones do not sound during that 
day.

Understanding System Requirements
The E7000 web-based UI requires a secure Hypertext Transfer Proto-
col Secure (https) type network connection to the E7000 system
server. Users can log in to the E7000 system using the Google
Chrome web browser from a computer or tablet running either a
Windows 8.1 (or later) or a Mac OS X 10.12.x (or later) operating
system (OS). The UI can also be accessed via a Chrome browser
enabled Android-based tablet or mobile device. To access the server,
type your server’s IP address (for example, 10.10.20.12).
1.1.1
Whitelisted Web Addresses
E7000 requires access to specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
commonly referred to as web addresses. Access to many of these
web addresses is required during installation; access to other web
addresses, such as the address for the Network Time Server (NTS) are
required during runtime. The Information Technology (IT) depart-
ment for the site must whitelist the web addresses so that they can
be easily accessed as needed.
The following table lists the URLs that must be whitelisted.

default, this new routine is not enabled. It also has no Triggers or 
Actions.
To add a routine:
Step 1
On the navigation bar, select Routines.
Step 2
On the Routines page, select the Add icon.
The Edit Routine page appears (see ""Editing a Routine” on page 387).

to a more descriptive name. The Edit Routine page allows you to set 
other parameters for the routine (see Table 13-1, “Routines Parame-
ters,” on page 385).
Note: When a Routine is added, edited, or deleted, all Admin 
phones will automatically be rebooted to update their Routines 
menu.

Creating and Executing Multi-Site Routines
You can create a routine to be launched on one or more remote sites, 
such as a lockdown routine to be launched at all sites in a district.
To create such a routine, you would select the Routine action Type 
(see ""Actions” on page 402 and ""Understanding Action Parameters” on 
page 406). You can select to execute the action on the local facility, a 
specific facility, or all facility. If you want to execute the routine or 
multiple, but not all, facilities, you must create a separate action for 
each facility (using Routine action Type).
When you select a specific facility, you can enter the DTMF code of 
the routine. A routine with that DTMF code must exist on that facility.
Routines that are triggered by another site will not execute calling or 
paging type actions. Also, the receiving facility must have Use Caller 
Extension disabled.
Note: There will be a one-second delay between execution of one 
Routine action and another Routine action. So, if you execute a 
multi-site routine for 10 sites, there will be 10-second delay 
between when the routine starts on the first facility and when it 
starts on the tenth facility. To eliminate this delay, you can select 
All Facilities and then ensure that a routine with the specified 
DTMF does not exist on the sites that you do not want to run the 
routine. If All Facilities is selected, the remote routines start at the 
same time.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

What types of devices can be classified as an E7000 station?,"3 Managing Stations, 
Zones, and Queues
105
Managing Stations, Zones, and 
Queues
You can divide your facility into zones to control paging and audio 
activities or features. For example, suppose you want to allow the use 
of an audio source, such as a flash drive, in a cafeteria but prevent it 
from being played in a conference room. This feature, called audio 
distribution, can be turned on by zone, so the cafeteria could be 
placed in a zone that allows audio distribution while conference 
rooms would not be placed into that zone.
No limit exists for the number of zones or for the number of stations 
that can be in a multicast zone. Performance limits do exist for unicast 
connections. The station limit for your system is determined by your 
license (see ""NQ-E7000SSL – Nyquist E7000 System Station License” 
on page 486).
With the Page Queuing feature, you can record an unlimited number 
of pages or messages for queuing (stacking) for a specified zone or 
zones. A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may 
have multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before 
a queue can be created.
A station can be in multiple zones.
An E7000 station is: 
• A device used to access the web interface
• A speaker
• A phone 
• A Nyquist appliance
Note: For licensing purposes, an I/O Controller is not counted as a 
station.
106
To manage stations and zones, you first add stations and then create 
zones that contain more than one station. You can add stations by 
allowing the Nyquist server to automatically discover the device type, 
MAC address, IP address, and serial number, or manually add these 
and other parameters. For more information about adding a station, 
see ""Adding a Station” on page 153.
3.1
Viewing Station Configuration Settings
On the Stations page, you can:
• View all configured stations. 
• Edit a station’s configuration. (See ""Editing Station Configuration 
Settings” on page 118.)
• Exclude a station from paging. (See ""Excluding Stations from Pag-
ing” on page 162.)
• View station status. (See ""Viewing Station Status” on page 164.)
• Add new stations. (See ""Adding a Station” on page 153.)
• View the status of Nyquist appliances, such as the I/O controller. 
(See ""Viewing Appliance Status” on page 166.)
• Delete a station. (See ""Deleting a Station” on page 152.)

The Nyquist system server install involves the following tasks:
• Setting up a static IP address for the Nyquist E7000 server
• Copying and extracting the nyquist-e7000-xx.xx.xx.xxxx.tar.gz file
• Installing the Nyquist E7000 application software
Before installing Nyquist E7000, you must install the Debian OS (see 
""Installing Debian 8.xx.x AMD 64” on page 7).

Note: This manual describes the tasks, including configuration 
tasks, that you can perform if you are assigned an Admin role with 
proper permissions and if your station Type is an Admin Web 
Interface. If you are assigned a user role and your station’s Type is 
Web Interface, refer to the Non-Admin Web Interface User Guide 
and to ""Performing Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 of this 
manual. For information about station types, see ""Managing Sta-
tions, Zones, and Queues” on page 105. For information about 
roles, see ""Managing Roles and Users” on page 199.

The left side, or navigation bar, of the dashboard, lists the areas of the 
E7000 system that you can access. Accessibility to E7000 features and 
functionality is controlled by the user’s assigned role.
The right header ribbon provides the facility name, server time in 
hours and minutes, the username for the account and the extension 
for the station. The facility name and server time will not appear if the 
screen is reduced in size, such as when viewing from a phone or tab-
let.
Incoming Calls and Messages appear on the top right dashboard 
pane. 
The majority of the dashboard is set up to allow you to perform com-
munications activities, view this week’s bell schedules, and perform 
audio distribution.
The navigation bar does not appear for those users not authorized to 
make changes to the E7000 configuration. Instead, those users see 
only common tasks, such as calling an extension. See ""Performing 
Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 for details about tasks that 
office and teaching staff commonly perform. Chapter 9 of this 
manual can be distributed by itself to front office staff.
At the top of the dashboard, messages appear that can provide infor-
mation about your system, such as any stations or devices that were 
connected to your server but now are not appearing to be connected 
or responding. (See ""Dashboard Messages” on page 324.)
If the dashboard message “System is running in demonstration 
mode” appears, all E7000 functions are enabled but the maximum 
station count is set to 6 and the maximum number of simultaneous 
calls is set to 2.
If an I/O Controller rule’s Action has been set to Manual, a dash-
board button appears that can be used to manually close or open 
specified output contact. (See ""Viewing I/O Controller Configuration 
Rules” on page 120.)
On the lower part of the dashboard are options for Audio Distribu-
tion and an Enable/Disable Audio button that you can toggle to 
enable or disable audio.

Accessing the Dashboard
To access your dashboard:
Step 1
From your Chrome browser, type the E7000 system 
server’s IP address in the address bar (for example, 
https://192.168.1.0) and press Enter.
Step 2
On the Login page, type your username and password. 
Step 3
Select Login.
Note: The iOS device WiFi must be connected to the same network 
as the E7000 system server.

The dashboard that appears depends on whether your station is an 
Admin Web Interface or a non-administrator Web Interface.
If you are using the Admin Web Interface and have permissions for 
configuration tasks, your dashboard will appear like that in Figure 1-
4, E7000 Dashboard for Admin Web Interface. 
Figure 1-3,  Login Page
14
If you are logged in as a user and using the non-administrator Web 
Interface station Type, the dashboard will look like Figure 1-5, Non-
Administrator Web Interface.
Figure 1-4,  E7000 Dashboard for Admin Web Interface
Note: This manual describes the tasks, including configuration 
tasks, that you can perform if you are assigned an Admin role with 
proper permissions and if your station Type is an Admin Web 
Interface. If you are assigned a user role and your station’s Type is 
Web Interface, refer to the Non-Admin Web Interface User Guide 
and to ""Performing Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 of this 
manual. For information about station types, see ""Managing Sta-
tions, Zones, and Queues” on page 105. For information about 
roles, see ""Managing Roles and Users” on page 199.

The left side, or navigation bar, of the dashboard, lists the areas of the 
E7000 system that you can access. Accessibility to E7000 features and 
functionality is controlled by the user’s assigned role.
The right header ribbon provides the facility name, server time in 
hours and minutes, the username for the account and the extension 
for the station. The facility name and server time will not appear if the 
screen is reduced in size, such as when viewing from a phone or tab-
let.
Incoming Calls and Messages appear on the top right dashboard 
pane. 
The majority of the dashboard is set up to allow you to perform com-
munications activities, view this week’s bell schedules, and perform 
audio distribution.
The navigation bar does not appear for those users not authorized to 
make changes to the E7000 configuration. Instead, those users see 
only common tasks, such as calling an extension. See ""Performing 
Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 for details about tasks that 
office and teaching staff commonly perform. Chapter 9 of this 
manual can be distributed by itself to front office staff.
At the top of the dashboard, messages appear that can provide infor-
mation about your system, such as any stations or devices that were 
connected to your server but now are not appearing to be connected 
or responding. (See ""Dashboard Messages” on page 324.)
If the dashboard message “System is running in demonstration 
mode” appears, all E7000 functions are enabled but the maximum 
station count is set to 6 and the maximum number of simultaneous 
calls is set to 2.
If an I/O Controller rule’s Action has been set to Manual, a dash-
board button appears that can be used to manually close or open 
specified output contact. (See ""Viewing I/O Controller Configuration 
Rules” on page 120.)
On the lower part of the dashboard are options for Audio Distribu-
tion and an Enable/Disable Audio button that you can toggle to 
enable or disable audio.

at the time of installation.
Preconfigured rack system: Roll it in, connect the speaker wiring, and finish configuring the system using 
the intuitive setup wizard on the included laptop PC and the system is up and running!
Can run as a complete free-standing system: The self-contained nature of this solution does not impose 
upon the customer’s network or IT department.
A future-proofed solution that protects your investment: Upgradeable and expandable to adapt to the school’s 
changing needs. Also, networkable to inter-connect with other Nyquist systems across the entire district.
To help deliver on our goal of providing a self-contained system, the License Activation Key (LAK) gets 
applied during factory assembly to avoid the need for an Internet connection during installation.

Which Access settings permit users to initiate outgoing SIP calls from the Nyquist system?,"Accessing the Dashboard

2.3.1
How Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls
When a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on 
that SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter 
set in the Nyquist SIP trunk’s parameters. The Access parameter is set 
when editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see ""Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 and ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-
tion.
Based on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-
lowing:
• Routes the call to a DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
DISA functionality:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• DISA – Incoming only – No password
• DISA – Incoming only – Password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password
When the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will 
hear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any 
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a 
Nyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller 
can dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See ""Nyquist 
DTMF Feature Dialing Codes” on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)
When incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk 
Extension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type 
DISA Line; the associated station’s CoS configuration is used to 
determine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed 
to initiate. (See ""Adding CoS Parameters for a Station” on page 67.) 
Note: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-
tem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are 
ignored.
69
The Extension parameter is also used as the caller ID when a DISA 
user dials a station extension.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to 
Security DISA functionality:
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Security DISA – Incoming – Listen only
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, security DISA
The caller must enter a valid extension to be monitored and can only 
listen to calls or station locations.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
defined Day or Night Admin:
• Unrestricted
• Incoming Only
If the Day or Night Admin does not answer the incoming call, the call 
is routed, or rolled over, to the Admin Group. (See ""Using Admin 
Groups” on page 211.) 
If the call is not answered during night hours and the Night Ring 
option is enabled, the call is routed using the Night Ring functional-
ity. (See ""Setting Night Call Options” on page 31.) 
2.3.2
How Nyquist Handles Outgoing SIP Calls
Nyquist users can initiate outside calls by dialing a number that starts 
with the outside call prefix (98). Outside calls are only sent to SIP 
Trunks that have one of the following Access settings:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No Password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Unrestricted
• Outgoing Only
Note: Use the PBX Connection options only if the PBX accepts 7-
digit and 10-digit domestic and 12digit international PSTN tele-
phone numbers and can initiate outbound calls to specified tele-
phone numbers.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Call Detail Records
Call Detail Records (CDRs) are created when a routine is started. 
When started on a local facility, the Destination field will show Local 
Facility and the Type field will show Start Routine (<routine-
DTMF-code>).
When a routine is started on a selected remote facility, the CDR will 
show the remote facility name in the Destination field and Start 
Remote Routine (<routine-DTMF-code>) in the Type field.
When a routine is started on all facilities, the CDR will show All Facil-

Allowing Input Contact Closure to Initiate 
Ring-Tone to Speakers
Through the Routines feature, you can let an input contact closure 
initiate the playing of a ringtone to designated stations. 
To do this, create a routine (see ""Adding a Routine” on page 387) that 
uses Play-Ringtone as the action Type (see ""Understanding Action 
Parameters” on page 406). For the Action, select Start. Select the 
Zones that contain the speakers you want to play the ringtone.
To stop the ringtone, create a second routine that is triggered when 
the contact opens and uses the Stop for the Action.

Using Triggers
A trigger is an event that starts a routine. By default, when you create 
a routine, it has no trigger or actions.
A trigger can have up to two parameters. For example, you can create 
a trigger that uses a specific Announcement. The first parameter 
would be the Announcement Type (Number) and the second 
parameter would be the Announcement.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

The Extension parameter is also used as the caller ID when a DISA 
user dials a station extension.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to 
Security DISA functionality:
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Security DISA – Incoming – Listen only
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, security DISA
The caller must enter a valid extension to be monitored and can only 
listen to calls or station locations.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
defined Day or Night Admin:
• Unrestricted
• Incoming Only
If the Day or Night Admin does not answer the incoming call, the call 
is routed, or rolled over, to the Admin Group. (See ""Using Admin 
Groups” on page 211.) 
If the call is not answered during night hours and the Night Ring 
option is enabled, the call is routed using the Night Ring functional-

How Nyquist Handles Outgoing SIP Calls
Nyquist users can initiate outside calls by dialing a number that starts 
with the outside call prefix (98). Outside calls are only sent to SIP 
Trunks that have one of the following Access settings:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No Password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Unrestricted
• Outgoing Only
Note: Use the PBX Connection options only if the PBX accepts 7-
digit and 10-digit domestic and 12digit international PSTN tele-
phone numbers and can initiate outbound calls to specified tele-
phone numbers.

• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, No DISA 
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Bi-directional, Allow DISA, Password

When outside calls are placed, the outbound caller ID is set to the 
Direct Inward Dial (DID) defined for the SIP Trunk. (See ""Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 or ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72.)
When Access is set to 911 Only, only outgoing 911 calls may be 
routed on the associated SIP trunk. The DID parameter is not used 
for outgoing 911 calls; it is expected that the SIP trunk provider has 
mapped the Billing Telephone Number (BTN) to E911 service.
All outgoing calls are routed through the SIP trunk provider using the 
following SIP trunk configuration parameters:
• Host IP Address
• Username
• Password
If the SIP trunk provider expects all called numbers to be prefixed 
with a specific code, the Dial Prefix setting can be used to satisfy the 
requirement.
If the SIP trunk provider expects all called 7-digit numbers to be pre-
fixed with a specific local area code, the Local Area Code setting can 
be used to satisfy the requirement. (See ""Adding SIP Trunk Configura-
tion Parameters” on page 72.)

If you want a routine to pause until audio is re-enabled, use the Fea-
ture-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (parameter 1) set to Dis-
able-Audio. 
If audio is enabled when the Feature Wait action executes, the rou-
tine does not wait for audio to be disabled. Instead, it continues exe-
cuting subsequent actions.
13.11.7.8 Feature-Wait Action Type with Emerg-All-Call
If you want a routine to pause until an active Emergency All-Call page 
completes, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait

If no Emergency-All-Call page is playing when the Feature Wait 
action executes, the routine does not wait for an Emergency-All-Call 
page. Instead, it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you want to ensure that the routine includes an Emergency-All-Call 
page, use Emerg-All-Call as the trigger Type.
If you do not need the routine to wait until the Emergency-All-Call 
page finishes, you can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and 
Emerg-All-Call as Feature Wait and set Maximum Wait Time 
(action parameter 2) to the desired amount of time to wait.
13.11.7.9 Feature-Wait Action Type with Facility-Page
You can use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait 
(parameter 1) set to Facility-Page in a routine that is triggered by a 
facility page. The routine will pause subsequent actions until the facil-
ity page completes. If no facility page is playing when the Feature 
Wait action executes, the routine does not wait for a facility page. 
Instead, it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you do not need the routine to wait until the facility page finishes, 
you can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and Facility Page 
as Feature Wait and set Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) 
to the desired amount of time to wait.
Note: Only routines with the trigger Type set to Facility Page can 
use this action.

13.11.7.10 Feature-Wait Action Type with Multi-Site-All-Call
If you want a routine to pause until a Multi-Site-All-Call page com-
pletes, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (param-
eter 1) set to Multi-Site-All-Call.
If no Multi-Site-All-Call page is playing when the Feature Wait 
action executes, the routine does not wait for a Multi-Site-All-Call 
page. Instead, it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you want to ensure that the routine includes a Multi-Site-All-Call 
page, use Multi-Site-All-Call as the trigger Type.
This action will only wait on a Nyquist system that starts the Multi-
Site-All-Call. Remote sites that are included in a Multi-Site-All-Call 
only see a playing All-Call; they do not see it as a Multi-Site call. In 
this case, this action will have no affect.

13.11.7.7 Feature-Wait Action Type with Disable-Audio
If you want a routine to pause until audio is re-enabled, use the Fea-
ture-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (parameter 1) set to Dis-
able-Audio. 
If audio is enabled when the Feature Wait action executes, the rou-
tine does not wait for audio to be disabled. Instead, it continues exe-
cuting subsequent actions.
13.11.7.8 Feature-Wait Action Type with Emerg-All-Call
If you want a routine to pause until an active Emergency All-Call page 
completes, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait 
(parameter 1) set to Emerg-All-Call.
If no Emergency-All-Call page is playing when the Feature Wait 
action executes, the routine does not wait for an Emergency-All-Call 
page. Instead, it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you want to ensure that the routine includes an Emergency-All-Call 
page, use Emerg-All-Call as the trigger Type.
If you do not need the routine to wait until the Emergency-All-Call 
page finishes, you can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and 
Emerg-All-Call as Feature Wait and set Maximum Wait Time 
(action parameter 2) to the desired amount of time to wait.
13.11.7.9 Feature-Wait Action Type with Facility-Page
You can use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait 
(parameter 1) set to Facility-Page in a routine that is triggered by a 
facility page. The routine will pause subsequent actions until the facil-
ity page completes. If no facility page is playing when the Feature 
Wait action executes, the routine does not wait for a facility page. 
Instead, it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you do not need the routine to wait until the facility page finishes, 
you can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and Facility Page 
as Feature Wait and set Maximum Wait Time (action parameter 2) 
to the desired amount of time to wait.
Note: Only routines with the trigger Type set to Facility Page can 
use this action.

13.11.7.10 Feature-Wait Action Type with Multi-Site-All-Call
If you want a routine to pause until a Multi-Site-All-Call page com-
pletes, use the Feature-Wait action Type with Feature Wait (param-
eter 1) set to Multi-Site-All-Call.
If no Multi-Site-All-Call page is playing when the Feature Wait 
action executes, the routine does not wait for a Multi-Site-All-Call 
page. Instead, it continues executing subsequent actions.
If you want to ensure that the routine includes a Multi-Site-All-Call 
page, use Multi-Site-All-Call as the trigger Type.
This action will only wait on a Nyquist system that starts the Multi-
Site-All-Call. Remote sites that are included in a Multi-Site-All-Call 
only see a playing All-Call; they do not see it as a Multi-Site call. In 
this case, this action will have no affect.
If you do not need the routine to wait until the Multi-Site-All-Call 
page finishes, you can still use Feature-Wait as the action Type and

Which Access settings allow incoming SIP trunk calls to route to DISA functionality?,"Accessing the Dashboard
68
2.3.1
How Nyquist Handles Incoming SIP Calls
When a SIP trunk is enabled and Nyquist receives an incoming call on 
that SIP trunk, Nyquist routes the call based on the Access parameter 
set in the Nyquist SIP trunk’s parameters. The Access parameter is set 
when editing or adding SIP trunk configuration (see ""Editing a SIP 
Trunk Configuration” on page 81 and ""Adding SIP Trunk Configuration 
Parameters” on page 72) and must match the ITSP switch configura-
tion.
Based on the Access parameter setting, Nyquist does one of the fol-
lowing:
• Routes the call to a DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a Security DISA function/station
• Routes the call to a defined Day Admin or Night Admin
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
DISA functionality:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• DISA – Incoming only – No password
• DISA – Incoming only – Password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, No password
• PBX Connection – Incoming only. Allow DISA, Password
When the Nyquist system receives an incoming call, the caller will 
hear a dial tone. The caller can then dial any Nyquist extension or any 
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) code that is associated with a 
Nyquist feature. For example, after hearing the dial tone, the caller 
can dial #0911 to launch an Emergency All-Call page. (See ""Nyquist 
DTMF Feature Dialing Codes” on page 477 for a list of DTMF codes.)
When incoming calls are routed to the DISA function, the SIP trunk 
Extension setting is used to map the SIP trunk to a station of type 
DISA Line; the associated station’s CoS configuration is used to 
determine what Nyquist functions the incoming DISA user is allowed 
to initiate. (See ""Adding CoS Parameters for a Station” on page 67.) 
Note: If a SIP trunk is configured but disabled in the Nyquist Sys-
tem Parameters, then incoming calls from the SIP trunk are 
ignored.
69
The Extension parameter is also used as the caller ID when a DISA 
user dials a station extension.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to 
Security DISA functionality:
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Security DISA – Incoming – Listen only
• PBX Connection – Incoming only, security DISA
The caller must enter a valid extension to be monitored and can only 
listen to calls or station locations.
The following Access settings route the incoming SIP trunk call to the 
defined Day or Night Admin:
• Unrestricted
• Incoming Only
If the Day or Night Admin does not answer the incoming call, the call 
is routed, or rolled over, to the Admin Group. (See ""Using Admin 
Groups” on page 211.) 
If the call is not answered during night hours and the Night Ring 
option is enabled, the call is routed using the Night Ring functional-
ity. (See ""Setting Night Call Options” on page 31.) 
2.3.2
How Nyquist Handles Outgoing SIP Calls
Nyquist users can initiate outside calls by dialing a number that starts 
with the outside call prefix (98). Outside calls are only sent to SIP 
Trunks that have one of the following Access settings:
• DISA – Bi-directional – No Password
• DISA – Bi-directional – Password
• Security DISA – Bi-directional – Listen only
• Unrestricted
• Outgoing Only
Note: Use the PBX Connection options only if the PBX accepts 7-
digit and 10-digit domestic and 12digit international PSTN tele-
phone numbers and can initiate outbound calls to specified tele-
phone numbers.","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Using Audio Distribution
Audio distribution is specifying an audio program for distribution to 
stations or zones. It involves creating a playlist or selecting an input 
source and specifying which zones or stations hear the playlist or 
input source. Through the Scheduled Audio feature, audio distribu-
tion can be tied to a specific event in a schedule. For information 
about the Scheduled Audio feature, ""Understanding Event Settings” 
on page 228.
Note: Before using the Audio Distribution feature, make sure that 
stations and zones have been configured and that the station you 
are using to launch Audio Distribution has the appropriate Class of 
Service (CoS) parameters set.
Note: If an audio distribution playlist that has a station assigned to 
it is playing, you cannot play another audio distribution playlist 
with a station assigned.
354
To create an audio distribution:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.
Step 2
Select the Add icon.
Step 3
Use the Line-Input/Playlist/Source drop-down menu 
to select the audio source.
Step 4
Select the Zones and Stations.
Step 5
If you select Line-Input as the Input Source/Playlist, 
select the Amplifiers/Matrix Mixers and Input Chan-
nel.
Step 6
If you select a playlist and want to shuffle the song 
order, set Shuffle to Yes.
Step 7
Select Save.
Step 8
To end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next 
to the playlist.
Figure 11-18, Create an Audio Distribution
Note: If you are using at least one Nyquist Matrix Mixer Pre-Amp, 
Line-Input appears as a Input Source/Playlist option.
355
To launch a previously created audio distribution:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.
Step 2
Select the Play icon next to the audio distribution that 
you want to launch.
Step 3
To end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next 
to the playlist.
An existing Audio Distribution can be edited or deleted, 
provided it is not currently playing or linked to a rou-
tine, by selecting the Edit or Delete icon next to the 
Audio Distribution.
When Audio Distribution is enabled, an informational message 
appears in the Messages window of the Admin Web UI dashboard, 
indicating the song that is currently playing and to which speakers 
(all or selected) and to which zones audio is playing to.
Audio distribution will be paused automatically by higher priority fea-
ture activation (for example, All-Call Page, Paging, Tones) and will 
automatically resume when the higher priority feature is finished.
When another system feature pauses Audio Distribution, the mes-
sage on the dashboard messages window includes PAUSED to 
remind you that Audio Distribution is still enabled but is currently 
paused.
Audio Distribution may also be started or stopped using Admin 
Phones. (Audio Distribution is available on the Admin Phone by 
selecting Directory and then selecting Features.)
If you select Set after making selections in the Audio Distribution 
panel of the dashboard, the displayed settings are updated on the 
server to allow Admin IP Phones to start Audio Distribution using the 
displayed settings. Selecting Set only updates the settings; it does 
not start the audio distribution.
Audio Distribution volume can be changed by setting Audio Distri-
bution Volume, available in System Parameters. 
All Nyquist stations are pre-programmed to receive Audio Distribu-
tion to All Stations. To disable Audio Distribution to a specific station, 
change Multicast Audio Distribution to No on the Edit Station 
page.
When Audio Distribution is started via the Admin Phone, any Admin 
web UI or Admin phone user may stop the Audio Distribution if his or 
356
her station has the Audio Distribution CoS Configuration parameter 
enabled.
Scheduled Audio has a higher priority than Audio Distribution. If you 
are playing Audio Distribution and an event with Scheduled Audio 
interrupts, the Audio Distribution briefly plays between the tone and 
the Scheduled Audio. 
A playlist will continue playing until manually stopped.
If you use a USB memory stick as storage for songs on a playlist and 
the USB memory stick is removed from the USB drive, the metadata 
for the songs and the playlist still resides in the Nyquist song list and 
playlist, but audio distribution cannot play.
11.9
Enabling and Disabling Audio
If a station’s CoS has been set up to enable and disable audio, then 
Enable Audio and Disable Audio icons appear in the lower section 
of the dashboard. These icons allow a station to control audio for the 
system during events such as fire alarms. Selecting Disable Audio 
stops all audio output on the system– such as Scheduled Audio, 
audio distribution, and paging – and prevents future audio output 
until Enable Audio is selected. If you select Disable Audio, you must 
select Continue when prompted to stop audio. 
11.10
Manually Controlling Output Contacts
If you are using the Nyquist I/O Controller to recognize third-party 
contact closures, you can manually control output contacts. 
Prerequisites for using manual controls are adding an I/O Controller 
as a station and configuring a controller rule for at least one output 
contact with the Action set as Manual. (See ""Configuring I/O Control-
ler Output Rules” on page 130.)","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

To end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next 
to the playlist.
Figure 11-18, Create an Audio Distribution
Note: If you are using at least one Nyquist Matrix Mixer Pre-Amp, 
Line-Input appears as a Input Source/Playlist option.

To launch a previously created audio distribution:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.
Step 2
Select the Play icon next to the audio distribution that 
you want to launch.
Step 3
To end the playing of audio, select the Stop icon next 
to the playlist.
An existing Audio Distribution can be edited or deleted, 
provided it is not currently playing or linked to a rou-
tine, by selecting the Edit or Delete icon next to the 
Audio Distribution.
When Audio Distribution is enabled, an informational message 
appears in the Messages window of the Admin Web UI dashboard, 
indicating the song that is currently playing and to which speakers 
(all or selected) and to which zones audio is playing to.
Audio distribution will be paused automatically by higher priority fea-
ture activation (for example, All-Call Page, Paging, Tones) and will 
automatically resume when the higher priority feature is finished.
When another system feature pauses Audio Distribution, the mes-
sage on the dashboard messages window includes PAUSED to 
remind you that Audio Distribution is still enabled but is currently 
paused.
Audio Distribution may also be started or stopped using Admin 
Phones. (Audio Distribution is available on the Admin Phone by 
selecting Directory and then selecting Features.)
If you select Set after making selections in the Audio Distribution 
panel of the dashboard, the displayed settings are updated on the 
server to allow Admin IP Phones to start Audio Distribution using the 
displayed settings. Selecting Set only updates the settings; it does 
not start the audio distribution.
Audio Distribution volume can be changed by setting Audio Distri-
bution Volume, available in System Parameters. 
All Nyquist stations are pre-programmed to receive Audio Distribu-
tion to All Stations. To disable Audio Distribution to a specific station, 
change Multicast Audio Distribution to No on the Edit Station 
page.
When Audio Distribution is started via the Admin Phone, any Admin 
web UI or Admin phone user may stop the Audio Distribution if his or 
356
her station has the Audio Distribution CoS Configuration parameter 
enabled.
Scheduled Audio has a higher priority than Audio Distribution. If you 
are playing Audio Distribution and an event with Scheduled Audio 
interrupts, the Audio Distribution briefly plays between the tone and 
the Scheduled Audio. 
A playlist will continue playing until manually stopped.
If you use a USB memory stick as storage for songs on a playlist and 
the USB memory stick is removed from the USB drive, the metadata 
for the songs and the playlist still resides in the Nyquist song list and 
playlist, but audio distribution cannot play.
11.9
Enabling and Disabling Audio
If a station’s CoS has been set up to enable and disable audio, then 
Enable Audio and Disable Audio icons appear in the lower section 
of the dashboard. These icons allow a station to control audio for the 
system during events such as fire alarms. Selecting Disable Audio 
stops all audio output on the system– such as Scheduled Audio, 
audio distribution, and paging – and prevents future audio output 
until Enable Audio is selected. If you select Disable Audio, you must 
select Continue when prompted to stop audio. 
11.10
Manually Controlling Output Contacts
If you are using the Nyquist I/O Controller to recognize third-party 
contact closures, you can manually control output contacts. 
Prerequisites for using manual controls are adding an I/O Controller 
as a station and configuring a controller rule for at least one output 
contact with the Action set as Manual. (See ""Configuring I/O Control-
ler Output Rules” on page 130.)
        ```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

","Audio distribution can be interrupted by Scheduled Audio if an event with Scheduled Audio is activated while audio distribution is playing. In such cases, the audio distribution briefly plays before the Scheduled Audio takes over, as Scheduled Audio has a higher priority than Audio Distribution.","According to the provided information, Scheduled Audio can interrupt Audio Distribution in the following way:

""If you are playing Audio Distribution and an event with Scheduled Audio interrupts, the Audio Distribution briefly plays between the tone and the Scheduled Audio.""

This indicates that when a Scheduled Audio event is triggered, it will interrupt the currently playing Audio Distribution, causing the Audio Distribution to briefly play before the Scheduled Audio takes over.","Audio distribution can be interrupted by Scheduled Audio when an event with Scheduled Audio is activated. If audio distribution is playing, the audio distribution will briefly play between the tone and the Scheduled Audio before being interrupted."

Viewing Queues
Warning
Changes to queues – including adding a queue, modi-
fying an existing queue, or deleting a queue – will
result in the deletion of all recorded pages that have
not yet played. Changes should only be done after
business hours or during a small maintenance window
that does not exceed 5 minutes.
With the Page Queuing feature, you can record an unlimited number 
of pages or messages for queuing (stacking) for a specified zone or 
zones. A zone can only be added to a single queue, but a queue may 
have multiple zones associated with it. Zones must be created before 
a queue can be created.
Page Queuing is designed to eliminate feedback that can occur if a 
page is made in an area where a microphone and speaker are in close 
proximity. With page queuing, the page does not start until you (or 
the user recording the page) has indicated that the recording is com-
pleted.
Page Queuing also prevents page overlapping since pages sent to a 
queue play one at a time.
The Page Queuing feature differs from the Schedule Announcement 
(see ""Using the Schedule Announcement Feature” on page 239) and 
Record Announcement (see ""Monitoring/Recording” on page 479) 
features. The Schedule Announcement feature allows you to specify a 
date and time when the announcement is to be played, and the 
DTMF Code *990 allows a user to use the admin phone to record an 
announcement that is played immediately after it is recorded. 
Using the DTMF Codes *991 or *991*{Zone Number} or selecting 
Record Page from the Admin Phone or the Admin web UI allows you 
to initiate a queued page. 
When the DTMF Code #{Zone Number} is used to initiate a zone 
page, Nyquist will start a queued page if the zone belongs to a 
queue. If you want to start a real-time page to the zone instead, dial 
#{Zone Number}*.
With the Page Queuing feature, the recorded page is placed in a 
zone’s queue. The pages in the zone’s queue are played in the order 
that they are placed in the queue.

check-in but have not yet done so. 
To view check-in status:
Step 1
If not already on your dashboard, select Dashboard 
from the navigation bar.
Step 2
Under Calling/Paging, select Manage Check-In.
A separate tab appears so that you can toggle the 
dashboard and Manage Check-In views.
The status of each station appears in a color-coded box. The follow-
ing table explains the use of colors to describe status:
Note: You can also use the Maps feature to view check-in status.

Can holidays be used to override schedules on specific dates?,"Editing Outside Lines

Using the Holidays Management Tool
Holidays, which can be a single day or a range of dates, often require 
changes in schedule assignments. The holidays management tool 
allows you to enter ranges of days when all schedules are turned off 
and to add these holidays to the calendar via the Schedules feature. 
You can also export a holiday schedule as a .csv file and import the holi-
day schedule file to another Nyquist server. 
Holidays override other schedules that are set for a date range.
8.13.1
Viewing Holidays
Holidays affect the schedule of each facility managed by your 
Nyquist server. The Holidays page displays a list of all holidays that 
have been set up for the Nyquist system. Holidays take precedent 
over regular schedules. For example, suppose you configure Mon-
days to use a schedule called Regular that has tones sounding 
throughout the day to mark the ending and beginning of shift 
changes. If you set a holiday for Monday, May 28, then the holiday 
“overrules” the Regular schedule and tones do not sound during that 
day.

The dashboard that appears depends on whether your station is an 
Admin Web Interface or a non-administrator Web Interface.
If you are using the Admin Web Interface and have permissions for 
configuration tasks, your dashboard will appear like that in Figure 1-
4, E7000 Dashboard for Admin Web Interface. 
Figure 1-3,  Login Page
14
If you are logged in as a user and using the non-administrator Web 
Interface station Type, the dashboard will look like Figure 1-5, Non-
Administrator Web Interface.
Figure 1-4,  E7000 Dashboard for Admin Web Interface
Note: This manual describes the tasks, including configuration 
tasks, that you can perform if you are assigned an Admin role with 
proper permissions and if your station Type is an Admin Web 
Interface. If you are assigned a user role and your station’s Type is 
Web Interface, refer to the Non-Admin Web Interface User Guide 
and to ""Performing Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 of this 
manual. For information about station types, see ""Managing Sta-
tions, Zones, and Queues” on page 105. For information about 
roles, see ""Managing Roles and Users” on page 199.

The left side, or navigation bar, of the dashboard, lists the areas of the 
E7000 system that you can access. Accessibility to E7000 features and 
functionality is controlled by the user’s assigned role.
The right header ribbon provides the facility name, server time in 
hours and minutes, the username for the account and the extension 
for the station. The facility name and server time will not appear if the 
screen is reduced in size, such as when viewing from a phone or tab-
let.
Incoming Calls and Messages appear on the top right dashboard 
pane. 
The majority of the dashboard is set up to allow you to perform com-
munications activities, view this week’s bell schedules, and perform 
audio distribution.
The navigation bar does not appear for those users not authorized to 
make changes to the E7000 configuration. Instead, those users see 
only common tasks, such as calling an extension. See ""Performing 
Tasks Via the Dashboard” on page 331 for details about tasks that 
office and teaching staff commonly perform. Chapter 9 of this 
manual can be distributed by itself to front office staff.
At the top of the dashboard, messages appear that can provide infor-
mation about your system, such as any stations or devices that were 
connected to your server but now are not appearing to be connected 
or responding. (See ""Dashboard Messages” on page 324.)
If the dashboard message “System is running in demonstration 
mode” appears, all E7000 functions are enabled but the maximum 
station count is set to 6 and the maximum number of simultaneous 
calls is set to 2.
If an I/O Controller rule’s Action has been set to Manual, a dash-
board button appears that can be used to manually close or open 
specified output contact. (See ""Viewing I/O Controller Configuration 
Rules” on page 120.)
On the lower part of the dashboard are options for Audio Distribu-
tion and an Enable/Disable Audio button that you can toggle to 
enable or disable audio.
